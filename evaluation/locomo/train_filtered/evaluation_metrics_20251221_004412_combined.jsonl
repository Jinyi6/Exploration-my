{"data_source": "evaluation_metrics_20251221_004412_combined", "prompt": [{"content": "\n    You are an intelligent memory assistant tasked with retrieving accurate information from conversation memories.\n\n    # CONTEXT:\n    You have access to memories from two speakers in a conversation. These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references unless instructed to keep them.\n\n    Memories for user Tim:\n\n    [\n    \"10:22 am on 21 November, 2023: Tim and John share a love for reading and plan to continue exploring books and motivating each other.\",\n    \"9:52 am on 1 December, 2023: John asked Tim what he enjoys about fantasy novels so much.

{"data_source": "evaluation_metrics_20251221_004412_combined", "prompt": [{"content": "\n    You are an intelligent memory assistant tasked with retrieving accurate information from conversation memories.\n\n    # CONTEXT:\n    You have access to memories from two speakers in a conversation. These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references unless instructed to keep them.\n\n    Memories for user Tim:\n\n    [\n    \"7:48 pm on 21 May, 2023: John's goal is to improve his shooting percentage.\",\n    \"8:17 pm on 21 September, 2023: John has goals both on and off the court and is thinking about life after basketball (discussed on 2023-09-21).\",\n    \"4:21 pm on 16 July, 2023: John used his contacts in the basketball industry and his marketing skills to connect with big companies for endorsements.\",\n    \"8:17 pm on 21 September, 2023: Tim said it's great that John has goals both on and off the court and that it's wise to think about the future and building his brand\",\n    \"7:48 pm on 21 May, 2023: John has been practicing hard to achieve his goal of improving his shooting percentage.\",\n    \"8:17 pm on 21 September, 2023: John said he loves seeing himself get better and beat goals, as well as playing with teammates and having fans cheer\",\n    \"4:29 pm on 21 August, 2023: John's strength training has given him an upper hand over his opponents and helped him improve his basketball performance.\",\n    \"8:17 pm on 21 September, 2023: John said he loves playing pro basketball because it is a constant challenge that keeps him growing and provides a sense of satisfaction and purpose\",\n    \"4:29 pm on 21 August, 2023: John includes strength training in his routine because it builds muscle, increases power, prevents injuries, improves shooting accuracy, agility, and speed, and boosts his overall athleticism and confidence on the court.\",\n    \"5:26 pm on 2 January, 2024: John said basketball is still really important to him and that he practices and trains every day to stay in shape and improve; image: https://i.redd.it/oqnovgpaxdv51.jpg; title: a photo of a collection of harry potter books on a desk\",\n    \"7:54 pm on 17 August, 2023: John said the signed basketball motivates him to stay strong and give it his all.\",\n    \"4:29 pm on 21 August, 2023: John is happy with his progress in basketball and fitness and is excited to see what's next.\",\n    \"8:17 pm on 21 September, 2023: John said he has specific targets on the court, such as better shooting and making more of an impact, and off the court, he is looking into more endorsements and building his brand\",\n    \"4:29 pm on 21 August, 2023: John figured out a schedule with both basketball stuff and strength training to balance it out\",\n    \"8:17 pm on 21 September, 2023: John said he is grateful for his basketball career and shared a photo of a basketball ball on the ground with a basketball hoop in the background; image: https://c8.alamy.com/zooms/9/de5f1d4e73244a8f94b16a6b6d093748/ttnmea.jpg; title: a photo of a basketball ball on the ground with a basketball hoop in the background.\",\n    \"7:54 pm on 17 August, 2023: John said that his teammates signed a basketball to show their friendship and appreciation.\",\n    \"8:28 pm on 11 December, 2023: John described feeling great during the game, creating opportunities for his teammates, and noted the electric atmosphere in the arena due to playing against their rivals.\",\n    \"10:29 am on 9 August, 2023: John said that being surrounded by teammates who are equally passionate creates a strong bond and feels like having a second family; this is related to his sport.

Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references unless instructed to keep them.\n\n    Memories for user Tim:\n\n    [\n    \"7:48 pm on 21 May, 2023: John's goal is to improve his shooting percentage.\",\n    \"8:17 pm on 21 September, 2023: John has goals both on and off the court and is thinking about life after basketball (discussed on 2023-09-21).\",\n    \"8:17 pm on 21 September, 2023: Tim said it's great that John has goals both on and off the court and that it's wise to think about the future and building his brand\",\n    \"8:17 pm on 21 September, 2023: John said he loves seeing himself get better and beat goals, as well as playing with teammates and having fans cheer\",\n    \"8:17 pm on 21 September, 2023: John said he loves playing pro basketball because it is a constant challenge that keeps him growing and provides a sense of satisfaction and purpose\",\n    \"7:54 pm on 17 August, 2023: John said the signed basketball motivates him to stay strong and give it his all.\",\n    \"7:48 pm on 21 May, 2023: John has been practicing hard to achieve his goal of improving his shooting percentage.\",\n    \"4:29 pm on 21 August, 2023: John is happy with his progress in basketball and fitness and is excited to see what's next.\",\n    \"4:21 pm on 16 July, 2023: John used his contacts in the basketball industry and his marketing skills to connect with big companies for endorsements.\",\n    \"5:26 pm on 2 January, 2024: John said basketball is still really important to him and that he practices and trains every day to stay in shape and improve; image: https://i.redd.it/oqnovgpaxdv51.jpg; title: a photo of a collection of harry potter books on a desk\",\n    \"4:29 pm on 21 August, 2023: John's strength training has given him an upper hand over his opponents and helped him improve his basketball performance.\",\n    \"5:24 pm on 7 January, 2024: John said it's amazing how basketball brings people together and creates a positive impact.\",\n    \"5:24 pm on 7 January, 2024: John said the benefit basketball game turned out to be a total success with lots of people showing up, having a great time, and raising money for charity\",\n    \"7:54 pm on 17 August, 2023: John said that his teammates signed a basketball to show their friendship and appreciation.\",\n    \"8:17 pm on 21 September, 2023: John said he is grateful for his basketball career and shared a photo of a basketball ball on the ground with a basketball hoop in the background; image: https://c8.alamy.com/zooms/9/de5f1d4e73244a8f94b16a6b6d093748/ttnmea.jpg; title: a photo of a basketball ball on the ground with a basketball hoop in the background.\",\n    \"4:29 pm on 21 August, 2023: John includes strength training in his routine because it builds muscle, increases power, prevents injuries, improves shooting accuracy, agility, and speed, and boosts his overall athleticism and confidence on the court.\",\n    \"8:28 pm on 11 December, 2023: John described feeling great during the game, creating opportunities for his teammates, and noted the electric atmosphere in the arena due to playing against their rivals.\",\n    \"1:50 pm on 13 October, 2023: John said he is feeling motivated and ready to keep pushing for his goals.\",\n    \"8:17 pm on 21 September, 2023: Tim said it's great that John has a passion that helps him grow and reach his goals and that achieving and feeling fulfilled must be amazing\",\n    \"8:17 pm on 21 September, 2023: John said it's important for him to think about life after basketball\",\n    \"8:17 pm on 21 September, 2023: John said he has specific targets on the court, such as better shooting and making more of an impact, and off the court, he is looking into more endorsements and building his brand\",\n    \"11:41 am on 6 November, 2023: John provided an example from basketball, recalling a game last year where his team was trailing in the 4th quarter and had to dig deep to overturn the deficit, leading to an unforgettable feeling when they won.

These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references unless instructed to keep them.\n\n    Memories for user Tim:\n\n    [\n    \"5:26 pm on 2 January, 2024: Tim mentioned that he has a map of Middle-earth from LOTR, which is cool to see all the different realms and regions; image: https://i.redd.it/or3d42qfg4t91.jpg; title: a photo of a map of the world on a piece of paper.\",\n    \"8:17 pm on 21 September, 2023: Tim suggested Edinburgh, Scotland for their trip, citing its magical vibe, connection to Harry Potter, awesome history and architecture, and its beauty.\",\n    \"6:59 pm on 26 August, 2023: Tim added NYC to his travel list and expressed eagerness to visit\",\n    \"7:48 pm on 21 May, 2023: Tim mentioned that he went to a place in London a few years ago which felt like walking into a Harry Potter movie, and he also went on a tour which was amazing.

These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references unless instructed to keep them.\n\n    Memories for user Tim:\n\n    [\n    \"6:59 pm on 26 August, 2023: Tim added NYC to his travel list and expressed eagerness to visit\",\n    \"6:59 pm on 26 August, 2023: Tim expressed admiration for the NYC skyline and mentioned wanting to visit NYC\",\n    \"6:59 pm on 26 August, 2023: John offered to help Tim with planning his visit to NYC\",\n    \"6:59 pm on 26 August, 2023: Tim expressed enthusiasm about experiencing NYC for himself\",\n    \"5:08 pm on 15 June, 2023: Tim said he would support John and expressed excitement about what's up, mentioning his book collection.\",\n    \"6:59 pm on 26 August, 2023: John said that Tim has an awesome book collection and it's cool to escape to different worlds with a hobby; image: https://i.pinimg.com/originals/90/49/55/904955fe77567cf689d7db0ce606717d.jpg; title: a photo of a cityscape with a view of a skyscraper\",\n    \"5:26 pm on 2 January, 2024: Tim said he loves escaping to another world through reading and has a collection of books that take him there; image: https://i.pinimg.com/originals/96/80/20/968020204c99f3f30554384d39fe598b.jpg; title: a photo of a desk with a chair and a book shelf\",\n    \"5:26 pm on 2 January, 2024: John said he understands why reading means so much to Tim and thanked Tim for showing his collection\",\n    \"7:48 pm on 21 May, 2023: Tim has not yet visited any of the real Harry Potter places but would like to explore them someday.\",\n    \"5:08 pm on 15 June, 2023: John praised Tim's enthusiasm for the picture and his collection.\",\n    \"5:34 pm on 6 December, 2023: Tim said he appreciates the offer.\",\n    \"3:35 pm on 26 December, 2023: Tim is excited to watch a new show called 'The Wheel of Time' that is based on a book series he loves.\",\n    \"5:26 pm on 2 January, 2024: John asked Tim which book in his collection takes him to another world best\",\n    \"7:48 pm on 21 May, 2023: Tim encouraged John to add visiting the real Potter places to his list and offered to provide tips for visiting if needed.\",\n    \"4:17 pm on 2 August, 2023: Tim said, 'Same here!'\",\n    \"8:17 pm on 21 September, 2023: Tim noticed John had 'The Alchemist' on his bookshelf and asked if he enjoyed it\",\n    \"7:54 pm on 17 August, 2023: Tim is thankful for such experiences and appreciates people who share his interests.\",\n    \"5:08 pm on 15 June, 2023: Tim said that reminders help him escape the daily grind and that he might visit more HP spots in the future; he feels like he's stepping into the books.\",\n    \"3:35 pm on 26 December, 2023: Tim visited a travel agency to check the requirements for his next dream trip\",\n    \"7:48 pm on 21 May, 2023: John asked Tim about the kind of collaborations he is involved in for the fan project and mentioned his love for talking about his sneaker collection.\",\n    \"2:52 pm on 31 August, 2023: Tim is going to Universal Studios for the first time and is excited about the Harry Potter stuff.\",\n    \"3:36 pm on 11 November, 2023: Tim expressed admiration for John's road trip and the beautiful places they visited\",\n    \"5:51 pm on 21 October, 2023: Tim mentioned reading an awesome book about castles in the UK and found it interesting and impressive; he dreams of visiting them one day.\",\n    \"5:34 pm on 6 December, 2023: Tim thanked John for the offer.\",\n    \"3:35 pm on 26 December, 2023: Tim said 'Talk to you later!'\",\n    \"4:21 pm on 16 July, 2023: Tim wished John good luck with everything\",\n    \"4:29 pm on 21 August, 2023: John said he is glad Tim had fun\",\n    \"9:52 am on 1 December, 2023: Tim agreed that these places can calm and remind people of the beauty around them\",\n    \"3:37 pm on 16 December, 2023: Tim responded by saying he was glad everyone had fun.\",\n    \"6:59 pm on 26 August, 2023: John described his experience in NYC as amazing, highlighting the excitement of exploring the city and trying all the restaurants\",\n    \"4:29 pm on 21 August, 2023: Tim associates 'Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone' with great memories from watching it with his family.

{"data_source": "evaluation_metrics_20251221_004412_combined", "prompt": [{"content": "\n    You are an intelligent memory assistant tasked with retrieving accurate information from conversation memories.\n\n    # CONTEXT:\n    You have access to memories from two speakers in a conversation. These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references unless instructed to keep them.\n\n    Memories for user Tim:\n\n    [\n    \"4:17 pm on 2 August, 2023: Tim has been writing about different fantasy novels, studying characters, themes, and making book recommendations (originally stated as 'I've been writing about different fantasy novels, studying characters, themes, and making book recommendations').\",\n    \"4:17 pm on 2 August, 2023: Tim is writing articles about fantasy novels for an online magazine (originally stated as 'something awesome happened - I'm writing articles about fantasy novels for an online mag').\",\n    \"5:51 pm on 21 October, 2023: Tim replied that his writing is going well, and he is working on a fantasy novel.

{"data_source": "evaluation_metrics_20251221_004412_combined", "prompt": [{"content": "\n    You are an intelligent memory assistant tasked with retrieving accurate information from conversation memories.\n\n    # CONTEXT:\n    You have access to memories from two speakers in a conversation. These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references unless instructed to keep them.\n\n    Memories for user Tim:\n\n    [\n    \"10:29 am on 9 August, 2023: Tim is currently reading a fantasy book by Patrick Rothfuss; the book captivates him and transports him to another world where his imagination soars.\",\n    \"5:24 pm on 7 January, 2024: Tim is currently reading a fantasy novel called 'The Name of the Wind' by Patrick Rothfuss and that it's really good.\",\n    \"7:42 pm on 8 December, 2023: Tim mentioned that he has only read the GoT series by George R.

If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references unless instructed to keep them.\n\n    Memories for user Tim:\n\n    [\n    \"6:59 pm on 26 August, 2023: John shared a picture from a trip to New York City\",\n    \"6:59 pm on 26 August, 2023: John described his experience in NYC as amazing, highlighting the excitement of exploring the city and trying all the restaurants\",\n    \"4:21 pm on 16 July, 2023: John mentioned that Seattle is one of his favorite cities to explore because it is super vibrant\",\n    \"6:59 pm on 26 August, 2023: John offered to help Tim with planning his visit to NYC\",\n    \"8:17 pm on 21 September, 2023: John said they are planning to take a team trip next month (time relative to a specific day: '21 September, 2023') to explore a new city and have some fun.\",\n    \"8:17 pm on 21 September, 2023: Tim asked John where they are headed for their trip.\",\n    \"1:41 pm on 12 January, 2024: John recommended Barcelona as a must-visit city, highlighting its culture, architecture, food, and nearby beaches (originally stated as 1:41 pm on 12 January, 2024).\",\n    \"3:36 pm on 11 November, 2023: Tim expressed admiration for John's road trip and the beautiful places they visited\",\n    \"6:59 pm on 26 August, 2023: John mentioned that NYC has a lot to check out, including culture and food, and that it's an adventure one won't regret\",\n    \"5:26 pm on 2 January, 2024: John said he loves traveling because it's a way to learn about different cultures and places;

{"data_source": "evaluation_metrics_20251221_004412_combined", "prompt": [{"content": "\n    You are an intelligent memory assistant tasked with retrieving accurate information from conversation memories.\n\n    # CONTEXT:\n    You have access to memories from two speakers in a conversation. These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references unless instructed to keep them.\n\n    Memories for user Tim:\n\n    [\n    \"4:21 pm on 16 July, 2023: Tim asked John if similar feelings of shared passion happen in his sport too\",\n    \"7:42 pm on 8 December, 2023: Tim said that John's team has something similar to the characters in the series, who rely on each other to push through challenges; he asked John what book he is currently reading\",\n    \"7:42 pm on 8 December, 2023: John asked Tim about the series he is reading and confirmed that the importance of friendship is emphasized, similar to his team's approach; he mentioned that the team has team dinners, outings, and basketball games to build unity; image: https://live.staticflickr.com/5128/5297313790_4330145c09_b.jpg; title: a photography of a group of people sitting around a table eating\",\n    \"10:29 am on 9 August, 2023: John said that being surrounded by teammates who are equally passionate creates a strong bond and feels like having a second family; this is related to his sport.

These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references unless instructed to keep them.\n\n    Memories for user Tim:\n\n    [\n    \"2:52 pm on 31 August, 2023: Tim is planning a trip to Universal Studios next month (time relative to a specific day: '31 August, 2023').\",\n    \"7:54 pm on 17 August, 2023: Tim has no big events coming up but is hoping to attend a book conference next month (time relative to a specific day: '17 August 2023', i.e., September 2023).\",\n    \"3:35 pm on 26 December, 2023: Tim visited a travel agency to see what the requirements would be for his next dream trip (on 26 December, 2023 at 3:35 pm).\",\n    \"6:59 pm on 26 August, 2023: Tim added NYC to his travel list and expressed eagerness to visit\",\n    \"8:17 pm on 21 September, 2023: John asked Tim for book recommendations for his trip (discussed on 2023-09-21).\",\n    \"3:35 pm on 26 December, 2023: John offered to help Tim when they let him know about their plans (on 26 August, 2023 at 6:59 pm).

{"data_source": "evaluation_metrics_20251221_004412_combined", "prompt": [{"content": "\n    You are an intelligent memory assistant tasked with retrieving accurate information from conversation memories.\n\n    # CONTEXT:\n    You have access to memories from two speakers in a conversation. These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references unless instructed to keep them.\n\n    Memories for user Tim:\n\n    [\n    \"11:41 am on 6 November, 2023: Tim recommended visiting castles in Europe, saying they are magical.\",\n    \"1:41 pm on 12 January, 2024: Tim finds Barcelona awesome and decides to add it to his travel list (1:41 pm on 12 January, 2024).\",\n    \"8:17 pm on 21 September, 2023: Tim suggested Edinburgh, Scotland for their trip, citing its magical vibe, connection to Harry Potter, awesome history and architecture, and its beauty.\",\n    \"6:59 pm on 26 August, 2023: Tim added NYC to his travel list and expressed eagerness to visit\",\n    \"5:51 pm on 21 October, 2023: Tim mentioned reading an awesome book about castles in the UK and found it interesting and impressive; he dreams of visiting them one day.\",\n    \"1:41 pm on 12 January, 2024: Tim said he is proud of researching visa requirements for countries he wants to visit, as it feels like taking initiative towards making his travel dreams a reality (originally stated as 1:41 pm on 12 January, 2024).\",\n    \"3:59 pm on 16 November, 2023: Tim went to a castle during his trip to the UK last Friday (time relative to a specific day: 'last Friday') and found the architecture and history amazing; image: https://static.independent.co.uk/2021/07/28/09/26073722-6212c4b6-62f4-4d1f-b2d9-fab1e4ba16a8.jpg; title: a photo of a castle with a river running through it\",\n    \"7:48 pm on 21 May, 2023: Tim mentioned that he went to a place in London a few years ago which felt like walking into a Harry Potter movie, and he also went on a tour which was amazing.

{"data_source": "evaluation_metrics_20251221_004412_combined", "prompt": [{"content": "\n    You are an intelligent memory assistant tasked with retrieving accurate information from conversation memories.\n\n    # CONTEXT:\n    You have access to memories from two speakers in a conversation. These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references unless instructed to keep them.\n\n    Memories for user Tim:\n\n    [\n    \"3:00 pm on 2 October, 2023: John admires LeBron's work ethic and dedication to the game.\",\n    \"11:41 am on 6 November, 2023: John said that LeBron's moments of determination and heart are incredible and that it's why he enjoys playing and pushing himself.\",\n    \"11:41 am on 6 November, 2023: John and Tim both admire LeBron's determination and heart, which they believe are key reasons they enjoy basketball and push themselves.\",\n    \"3:00 pm on 2 October, 2023: John's favorite basketball player is LeBron.\",\n    \"3:00 pm on 2 October, 2023: John found meeting LeBron to be a wild experience.\",\n    \"3:00 pm on 2 October, 2023: John has met LeBron a few times.\",\n    \"3:00 pm on 2 October, 2023: John found watching LeBron play live to be tough but educational.\",\n    \"3:00 pm on 2 October, 2023: John has seen LeBron play live.\",\n    \"8:17 pm on 21 September, 2023: John said he loves seeing himself get better and beat goals, as well as playing with teammates and having fans cheer\",\n    \"11:41 am on 6 November, 2023: John recalled the epic block in Game 7 of the '16 Finals by LeBron, where he chased down Iguodala and pinned the ball against the backboard.\",\n    \"11:41 am on 6 November, 2023: Tim agreed that moments like LeBron's block make him love sports and admire players' determination and heart.\",\n    \"7:48 pm on 21 May, 2023: John said that things are going well with the new team and that the team has been really nice, and he is having fun.\",\n    \"5:08 pm on 15 June, 2023: John said he was playing in the game and that it was awesome being on the court doing what he loves.\",\n    \"10:29 am on 9 August, 2023: John said that being surrounded by teammates who are equally passionate creates a strong bond and feels like having a second family; this is related to his sport.

{"data_source": "evaluation_metrics_20251221_004412_combined", "prompt": [{"content": "\n    You are an intelligent memory assistant tasked with retrieving accurate information from conversation memories.\n\n    # CONTEXT:\n    You have access to memories from two speakers in a conversation. These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references unless instructed to keep them.\n\n    Memories for user Tim:\n\n    [\n    \"11:41 am on 6 November, 2023: John mentioned that he and his wife just left for a short but sweet European vacation and asked Tim for recommendations.\",\n    \"3:36 pm on 11 November, 2023: John went on a road trip along the European coastline with his wife; the trip was described as amazing with spectacular views and bonding experiences; image: https://familyadventuresva.files.wordpress.com/2022/03/img_5178.jpg; title: a photo of a group of people sitting on top of a mountain\",\n    \"11:41 am on 6 November, 2023: Tim thanked John and wished him and his wife a great time on their vacation, telling him to stay safe and stay in touch.\",\n    \"7:54 pm on 17 August, 2023: John met back up with his teammates on 15 August 2023 (originally stated as the 15th) after his trip and felt a warm welcome from them.\",\n    \"8:17 pm on 21 September, 2023: John asked Tim for book recommendations for his trip (discussed on 2023-09-21).\",\n    \"3:00 pm on 2 October, 2023: John and his bride had their first dance at a cozy restaurant with candlelight and music, which he described as dreamy.\",\n    \"3:00 pm on 2 October, 2023: Tim congratulated John and his new wife, expressing happiness and stating that love is magical and brings joy.\",\n    \"1:41 pm on 12 January, 2024: Tim thanked John for the advice and said he would keep him in the loop about his travels (originally stated as 1:41 pm on 12 January, 2024).\",\n    \"8:17 pm on 21 September, 2023: John said they are planning to take a team trip next month (time relative to a specific day: '21 September, 2023') to explore a new city and have some fun.\",\n    \"6:59 pm on 26 August, 2023: John shared a picture from a trip to New York City\",\n    \"3:00 pm on 2 October, 2023: John celebrated a wedding day that he described as beautiful and filled with love and happiness.\",\n    \"3:00 pm on 2 October, 2023: John's favorite memory was seeing his bride walking down the aisle, which emotionally moved him and he described as a magical moment.\",\n    \"9:52 am on 1 December, 2023: John answered that they went camping in the mountains, which was stunning, and the air was very refreshing\",\n    \"8:17 pm on 21 September, 2023: Tim asked John where they are headed for their trip.\",\n    \"8:17 pm on 21 September, 2023: John said they liked the suggestion of Edinburgh and considered it worth considering for their trip.\",\n    \"1:41 pm on 12 January, 2024: John offers to help Tim with any other questions or travel-related needs (1:41 pm on 12 January, 2024).\",\n    \"1:50 pm on 17 October, 2023: Tim said John is doing a great job with them and congratulated him.

These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references unless instructed to keep them.\n\n    Memories for user Tim:\n\n    [\n    \"8:28 pm on 11 December, 2023: Tim congratulated John on his career-high in assists and asked about the feeling of making those plays.\",\n    \"8:28 pm on 11 December, 2023: John congratulated Tim on his analysis and mentioned having a career-high in assists last Friday (time relative to a specific day: 'last Friday') in a big game against their rival; image: https://i.pinimg.com/originals/cf/a0/7f/cfa07fa76047b5d731b3af313d98fc01.jpg; title: a photo of a basketball game being played in a large arena.\",\n    \"6:59 pm on 26 August, 2023: John confirmed his willingness to assist Tim whenever needed (on 26 August, 2023 at 6:59 pm).\",\n    \"1:41 pm on 12 January, 2024: John described feeling crazy about sealing the deal and emphasized that it felt like all his hard work and training hours had paid off.

{"data_source": "evaluation_metrics_20251221_004412_combined", "prompt": [{"content": "\n    You are an intelligent memory assistant tasked with retrieving accurate information from conversation memories.\n\n    # CONTEXT:\n    You have access to memories from two speakers in a conversation. These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references unless instructed to keep them.\n\n    Memories for user Tim:\n\n    [\n    \"3:35 pm on 26 December, 2023: John is happy he could share his knowledge and help out (originally stated as 'I'm really happy I could share my knowledge and help out')\",\n    \"4:21 pm on 16 July, 2023: John used his contacts in the basketball industry and his marketing skills to connect with big companies for endorsements.\",\n    \"3:00 pm on 2 October, 2023: Tim said his friendship means a lot to John and that he is here for him anytime.

These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references unless instructed to keep them.\n\n    Memories for user Tim:\n\n    [\n    \"4:29 pm on 21 August, 2023: Tim responded that the tree picture looks awesome and adds holiday cheer to the house, and shared a photo of their own Christmas tree with a Harry Potter theme; image: https://i.pinimg.com/originals/2d/be/40/2dbe40682781579e457e7ee5a0cc79fc.jpg; title: a photo of a christmas tree with a harry potter theme\",\n    \"5:08 pm on 15 June, 2023: Tim mentioned that the picture on his bookshelf is from MinaLima, a company that created all the props for the Harry Potter films, and that he loves their work.\",\n    \"9:52 am on 1 December, 2023: Tim mentioned being glad they are friends and noted that they both share an interest in fantasy books and movies.

{"data_source": "evaluation_metrics_20251221_004412_combined", "prompt": [{"content": "\n    You are an intelligent memory assistant tasked with retrieving accurate information from conversation memories.\n\n    # CONTEXT:\n    You have access to memories from two speakers in a conversation. These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references unless instructed to keep them.\n\n    Memories for user Tim:\n\n    [\n    \"4:21 pm on 16 July, 2023: John and his teammates celebrated their win at a restaurant, where they were exhausted but happy and relived the intense moments\",\n    \"8:17 pm on 21 September, 2023: John attended a local restaurant with new teammates last week (time relative to a specific day: 'last week')\",\n    \"8:17 pm on 21 September, 2023: John and his new teammates had a lot of fun during the restaurant visit.\",\n    \"7:54 pm on 17 August, 2023: John met back up with his teammates on 15 August 2023 (originally stated as the 15th) after his trip and felt a warm welcome from them.\",\n    \"8:17 pm on 21 September, 2023: John said he loves seeing himself get better and beat goals, as well as playing with teammates and having fans cheer\",\n    \"3:00 pm on 2 October, 2023: John and his bride had their first dance at a cozy restaurant with candlelight and music, which he described as dreamy.\",\n    \"7:54 pm on 17 August, 2023: John said that his teammates signed a basketball to show their friendship and appreciation.\",\n    \"3:00 pm on 2 October, 2023: John celebrated a wedding day that he described as beautiful and filled with love and happiness.\",\n    \"10:29 am on 9 August, 2023: John and his teammates had an incredible experience during a game where they pulled off a tough win, and the atmosphere was electric\",\n    \"8:17 pm on 21 September, 2023: John felt that the new teammates are great friends and connected with them over their shared love for basketball.\",\n    \"10:29 am on 9 August, 2023: John said that being surrounded by teammates who are equally passionate creates a strong bond and feels like having a second family; this is related to his sport.

These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6.

{"data_source": "evaluation_metrics_20251221_004412_combined", "prompt": [{"content": "\n    You are an intelligent memory assistant tasked with retrieving accurate information from conversation memories.\n\n    # CONTEXT:\n    You have access to memories from two speakers in a conversation. These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references unless instructed to keep them.\n\n    Memories for user Tim:\n\n    [\n    \"5:34 pm on 6 December, 2023: Tim's current activities include school, reading fantasy books, and learning piano.

These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7.

{"data_source": "evaluation_metrics_20251221_004412_combined", "prompt": [{"content": "\n    You are an intelligent memory assistant tasked with retrieving accurate information from conversation memories.\n\n    # CONTEXT:\n    You have access to memories from two speakers in a conversation. These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references unless instructed to keep them.\n\n    Memories for user Tim:\n\n    [\n    \"2:52 pm on 31 August, 2023: John made a soup without following a recipe (originally stated as 'sort of made it up on the spot').\",\n    \"2:52 pm on 31 August, 2023: John added sage to the soup for flavor.\",\n    \"1:41 pm on 12 January, 2024: John responded that things have been good and mentioned something exciting happened recently.\",\n    \"8:17 pm on 21 September, 2023: John and Tim greeted each other and discussed how they have been recently.\",\n    \"3:36 pm on 11 November, 2023: John recently finished an amazing fantasy series that had many twists and was praised for its storylines and characters (conversation at 3:36 pm on 11 November, 2023).\",\n    \"5:51 pm on 21 October, 2023: John said no worries and hopes Tim enjoys the recipe, asking him to let him know how it turns out\",\n    \"5:51 pm on 21 October, 2023: Tim said he can't wait to try the recipe and thanked John for sharing it\",\n    \"5:51 pm on 21 October, 2023: John said he can write down the recipe and mail it to Tim\",\n    \"10:22 am on 21 November, 2023: John said/claims: 'Yeah, Tim!

These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references unless instructed to keep them.\n\n    Memories for user Tim:\n\n    [\n    \"8:17 pm on 21 September, 2023: John has goals both on and off the court and is thinking about life after basketball (discussed on 2023-09-21).\",\n    \"8:17 pm on 21 September, 2023: John said it's important for him to think about life after basketball\",\n    \"8:17 pm on 21 September, 2023: John said he loves playing pro basketball because it is a constant challenge that keeps him growing and provides a sense of satisfaction and purpose\",\n    \"8:17 pm on 21 September, 2023: John wants to use his platform to make a positive difference and inspire others, possibly by starting a foundation and doing charity work (discussed on 2023-09-21).\",\n    \"5:26 pm on 2 January, 2024: John said basketball is still really important to him and that he practices and trains every day to stay in shape and improve; image: https://i.redd.it/oqnovgpaxdv51.jpg; title: a photo of a collection of harry potter books on a desk\",\n    \"1:50 pm on 17 October, 2023: John is mentoring younger players on his team during the off-season; this is described as super rewarding and a great way to stay involved in the game.

{"data_source": "evaluation_metrics_20251221_004412_combined", "prompt": [{"content": "\n    You are an intelligent memory assistant tasked with retrieving accurate information from conversation memories.\n\n    # CONTEXT:\n    You have access to memories from two speakers in a conversation. These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references unless instructed to keep them.\n\n    Memories for user Tim:\n\n    [\n    \"3:00 pm on 2 October, 2023: John and his bride had their first dance at a cozy restaurant with candlelight and music, which he described as dreamy.\",\n    \"3:36 pm on 11 November, 2023: John went on a road trip along the European coastline with his wife; the trip was described as amazing with spectacular views and bonding experiences; image: https://familyadventuresva.files.wordpress.com/2022/03/img_5178.jpg; title: a photo of a group of people sitting on top of a mountain\",\n    \"3:00 pm on 2 October, 2023: Tim congratulated John and his new wife, expressing happiness and stating that love is magical and brings joy.\",\n    \"3:00 pm on 2 October, 2023: John's favorite memory was seeing his bride walking down the aisle, which emotionally moved him and he described as a magical moment.\",\n    \"11:41 am on 6 November, 2023: John mentioned that he and his wife just left for a short but sweet European vacation and asked Tim for recommendations.\",\n    \"11:41 am on 6 November, 2023: Tim thanked John and wished him and his wife a great time on their vacation, telling him to stay safe and stay in touch.\",\n    \"3:00 pm on 2 October, 2023: An image was shared of John and his bride walking down the aisle with the URL: 'https://images.pexels.com/photos/8815283/pexels-photo-8815283.jpeg'; title: 'a photography of a bride walking down the aisle with her groom'.\",\n    \"6:59 pm on 26 August, 2023: John shared a picture from a trip to New York City\",\n    \"3:00 pm on 2 October, 2023: John celebrated a wedding day that he described as beautiful and filled with love and happiness.\",\n    \"3:00 pm on 2 October, 2023: Tim expressed admiration for John's wedding day and asked about favorite memories from the event.\",\n    \"4:21 pm on 16 July, 2023: John and his teammates celebrated their win at a restaurant, where they were exhausted but happy and relived the intense moments\",\n    \"9:52 am on 1 December, 2023: John answered that they went camping in the mountains, which was stunning, and the air was very refreshing\",\n    \"6:59 pm on 26 August, 2023: John described his experience in NYC as amazing, highlighting the excitement of exploring the city and trying all the restaurants\",\n    \"4:21 pm on 16 July, 2023: John loves the ocean\",\n    \"3:00 pm on 2 October, 2023: John's hiking club friends attended the wedding even though he had just joined the club.\",\n    \"6:59 pm on 26 August, 2023: John offered to help Tim with planning his visit to NYC\",\n    \"3:35 pm on 26 December, 2023: John said that sounds exciting!\",\n    \"3:00 pm on 2 October, 2023: John said thanks and mentioned it was a great day with everyone present, which made it extra special; he believes such moments bring love and joy.\",\n    \"4:29 pm on 21 August, 2023: John said, 'Wow, that sounds great, Tim!

These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7.

{"data_source": "evaluation_metrics_20251221_004412_combined", "prompt": [{"content": "\n    You are an intelligent memory assistant tasked with retrieving accurate information from conversation memories.\n\n    # CONTEXT:\n    You have access to memories from two speakers in a conversation. These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references unless instructed to keep them.\n\n    Memories for user Tim:\n\n    [\n    \"1:50 pm on 17 October, 2023: John is mentoring younger players on his team during the off-season; this is described as super rewarding and a great way to stay involved in the game.

These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references unless instructed to keep them.\n\n    Memories for user Tim:\n\n    [\n    \"10:22 am on 21 November, 2023: Tim mentioned he has been swamped with studies and projects and had a setback last week (time relative to a specific day: 'last week') when he tried writing a story based on his experiences in the UK, but it didn't go as planned.\",\n    \"3:36 pm on 11 November, 2023: Tim enjoys being lost in awesome fantasy realms and mentions that 'That' is one of his favorite fantasy shows (conversation at 3:36 pm on 11 November, 2023).\",\n    \"3:36 pm on 11 November, 2023: Both Tim and John agree that books and movies can be a great escape (conversation at 3:36 pm on 11 November, 2023).\",\n    \"5:08 pm on 15 June, 2023: Tim joined a fantasy literature forum last night (originally stated as last night relative to 2023-06-15, i.e., 2023-06-14) and had a great talk about his favorite books; the conversation was enriching.\",\n    \"3:36 pm on 11 November, 2023: Tim and John are discussing the power and beauty of nature, which leaves them speechless and makes them realize how huge and special the world is (conversation at 3:36 pm on 11 November, 2023).\",\n    \"11:41 am on 6 November, 2023: Tim mentioned having a huge writing issue last week (time relative to a specific day: 'last week') where he got stuck on a plot twist and found it frustrating but eventually overcame it.\",\n    \"6:59 pm on 26 August, 2023: Tim thanked John for being helpful (on 26 August, 2023 at 6:59 pm).\",\n    \"3:35 pm on 26 December, 2023: John offered to help Tim when they let him know about their plans (on 26 August, 2023 at 6:59 pm).

{"data_source": "evaluation_metrics_20251221_004412_combined", "prompt": [{"content": "\n    You are an intelligent memory assistant tasked with retrieving accurate information from conversation memories.\n\n    # CONTEXT:\n    You have access to memories from two speakers in a conversation. These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references unless instructed to keep them.\n\n    Memories for user Tim:\n\n    [\n    \"7:54 pm on 17 August, 2023: Tim said that having something meaningful can keep you motivated and that he'll keep the conversation in mind next time he needs a push to reach his goals.\",\n    \"7:54 pm on 17 August, 2023: Tim said he will keep in mind the idea of having something meaningful to keep him motivated when he needs a push to reach his goals.\",\n    \"1:50 pm on 13 October, 2023: Tim said, 'You got this!

These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references unless instructed to keep them.\n\n    Memories for user Tim:\n\n    [\n    \"10:22 am on 21 November, 2023: John confirmed he read 'The Alchemist' and loved it, stating it made him think about life and the importance of following one's dreams, and he highly recommends it\",\n    \"10:22 am on 21 November, 2023: John recently finished rereading 'The Alchemist' and found it inspiring, motivating him to follow his dreams and trust the process.\",\n    \"8:17 pm on 21 September, 2023: Tim expressed gladness that John liked 'The Alchemist' and stated it is worth it\",\n    \"10:22 am on 21 November, 2023: Tim recalled reading 'The Alchemist' in the past, which changed his perspective on his goals.\",\n    \"8:17 pm on 21 September, 2023: Tim noticed John had 'The Alchemist' on his bookshelf and asked if he enjoyed it\",\n    \"8:28 pm on 11 December, 2023: John responds to Tim's encouragement, saying it means a lot and expressing a desire to keep pushing and follow their dreams to make a difference.\",\n    \"8:28 pm on 11 December, 2023: Tim agrees with John, saying they both have so much potential and should support each other on their journey towards their dreams.\",\n    \"1:08 pm on 11 August, 2023: John mentioned he is excited to work hard and make a positive impact.\",\n    \"5:51 pm on 21 October, 2023: John remarked that some authors have a significant influence on people, becoming part of their lives and affecting their interests.\",\n    \"10:22 am on 21 November, 2023: John and Tim both agree that books can have a significant impact on people, opening up new worlds, inspiring, and helping with personal growth.\",\n    \"1:08 pm on 11 August, 2023: Tim expressed admiration for John's efforts to make a difference and is looking forward to seeing the impact of John's charity work.\",\n    \"10:04 am on 19 December, 2023: John mentioned that being out in nature puts him in a great mood and energizes him\",\n    \"3:36 pm on 11 November, 2023: John emphasized that taking time for oneself is crucial, helping stay sharp, focused, gain new perspectives, and tackle challenges with more energy, and noted that finding the right balance is key (originally stated in the conversation).\",\n    \"5:26 pm on 2 January, 2024: John said Aragorn's brave, selfless, down-to-earth attitude is what inspired him.

{"data_source": "evaluation_metrics_20251221_004412_combined", "prompt": [{"content": "\n    You are an intelligent memory assistant tasked with retrieving accurate information from conversation memories.\n\n    # CONTEXT:\n    You have access to memories from two speakers in a conversation. These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references unless instructed to keep them.\n\n    Memories for user Tim:\n\n    [\n    \"5:34 pm on 6 December, 2023: Tim is learning how to play the violin and is mostly into classical music but is keen to try out jazz and film scores too; it's a great way to chill and get creative. ; image: https://i1.pickpik.com/photos/964/641/216/musical-instrument-violin-curl-tuning-pegs-preview.jpg; title: a photography of a violin and a violin stick on a sheet of music\",\n    \"5:34 pm on 6 December, 2023: Tim joined a travel club and is working on studies, picked up new skills, and recently started learning an instrument (vague time expression: 'recently').\",\n    \"3:35 pm on 26 December, 2023: Tim visited a travel agency to see what the requirements would be for his next dream trip (on 26 December, 2023 at 3:35 pm).\",\n    \"3:35 pm on 26 December, 2023: John offered to help Tim when they let him know about their plans (on 26 August, 2023 at 6:59 pm).

{"data_source": "evaluation_metrics_20251221_004412_combined", "prompt": [{"content": "\n    You are an intelligent memory assistant tasked with retrieving accurate information from conversation memories.\n\n    # CONTEXT:\n    You have access to memories from two speakers in a conversation. These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references unless instructed to keep them.\n\n    Memories for user Tim:\n\n    [\n    \"7:42 pm on 8 December, 2023: Tim mentioned that he just finished reading 'A Dance with Dragons' and highly recommends it; image: https://live.staticflickr.com/4467/24220955708_7548812488_b.jpg; title: a photography of a book shelf with a book and a book cover\",\n    \"5:08 pm on 15 June, 2023: Tim joined a fantasy literature forum last night (originally stated as last night relative to 2023-06-15, i.e., 2023-06-14) and had a great talk about his favorite books; the conversation was enriching.\",\n    \"8:17 pm on 21 September, 2023: Tim recommended a fantasy novel by Patrick Rothfuss, describing it as a book that'll take John to a different world and is great for traveling (discussed on 2023-09-21); image: https://live.staticflickr.com/3195/3322703152_057a33dca1_z.jpg; title: a photography of a book cover with a man in a hooded jacket\",\n    \"10:29 am on 9 August, 2023: Tim is currently reading a fantasy book by Patrick Rothfuss; the book captivates him and transports him to another world where his imagination soars.\",\n    \"8:17 pm on 21 September, 2023: John asked Tim for book recommendations for his trip (discussed on 2023-09-21).\",\n    \"5:24 pm on 7 January, 2024: Tim is currently reading a fantasy novel called 'The Name of the Wind' by Patrick Rothfuss and that it's really good.\",\n    \"7:54 pm on 17 August, 2023: Tim has no big events coming up but is hoping to attend a book conference next month (time relative to a specific day: '17 August 2023', i.e., September 2023).\",\n    \"10:22 am on 21 November, 2023: Tim recalled reading 'The Alchemist' in the past, which changed his perspective on his goals.\",\n    \"3:36 pm on 11 November, 2023: Both Tim and John agree that books and movies can be a great escape (conversation at 3:36 pm on 11 November, 2023).\",\n    \"10:29 am on 9 August, 2023: John will let Tim know his thoughts on the book once he finishes reading it.\",\n    \"10:29 am on 9 August, 2023: John asks Tim about the fantasy book he is currently reading and if anything has stood out to him.\",\n    \"7:42 pm on 8 December, 2023: Tim encouraged John to let him know if he gets around to reading George R.

{"data_source": "evaluation_metrics_20251221_004412_combined", "prompt": [{"content": "\n    You are an intelligent memory assistant tasked with retrieving accurate information from conversation memories.\n\n    # CONTEXT:\n    You have access to memories from two speakers in a conversation. These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references unless instructed to keep them.\n\n    Memories for user Tim:\n\n    [\n    \"1:41 pm on 12 January, 2024: John described feeling crazy about sealing the deal and emphasized that it felt like all his hard work and training hours had paid off.

These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4.

{"data_source": "evaluation_metrics_20251221_004412_combined", "prompt": [{"content": "\n    You are an intelligent memory assistant tasked with retrieving accurate information from conversation memories.\n\n    # CONTEXT:\n    You have access to memories from two speakers in a conversation. These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references unless instructed to keep them.\n\n    Memories for user Tim:\n\n    [\n    \"5:26 pm on 2 January, 2024: John said Aragorn's brave, selfless, down-to-earth attitude is what inspired him.

{"data_source": "evaluation_metrics_20251221_004412_combined", "prompt": [{"content": "\n    You are an intelligent memory assistant tasked with retrieving accurate information from conversation memories.\n\n    # CONTEXT:\n    You have access to memories from two speakers in a conversation. These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references unless instructed to keep them.\n\n    Memories for user Tim:\n\n    [\n    \"5:51 pm on 21 October, 2023: John said, 'This plaque I keep on my desk is a constant reminder to believe in myself.

These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references unless instructed to keep them.\n\n    Memories for user Tim:\n\n    [\n    \"8:17 pm on 21 September, 2023: John wants to use his platform to make a positive difference and inspire others, possibly by starting a foundation and doing charity work (discussed on 2023-09-21).\",\n    \"1:41 pm on 12 January, 2024: John praised Tim for taking initiative, stating it is a must if one wants to achieve their goals (originally stated as 1:41 pm on 12 January, 2024).\",\n    \"1:41 pm on 12 January, 2024: Tim said goodbye to John (1:41 pm on 12 January, 2024).\",\n    \"3:35 pm on 26 December, 2023: John offered to help Tim when they let him know about their plans (on 26 August, 2023 at 6:59 pm).

These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references unless instructed to keep them.\n\n    Memories for user Tim:\n\n    [\n    \"1:41 pm on 12 January, 2024: John recommended Barcelona as a must-visit city, highlighting its culture, architecture, food, and nearby beaches (originally stated as 1:41 pm on 12 January, 2024).\",\n    \"1:41 pm on 12 January, 2024: Tim thanked John for the advice and said he would keep him in the loop about his travels (originally stated as 1:41 pm on 12 January, 2024).\",\n    \"1:41 pm on 12 January, 2024: Tim finds Barcelona awesome and decides to add it to his travel list (1:41 pm on 12 January, 2024).\",\n    \"1:41 pm on 12 January, 2024: John offers to help Tim with any other questions or travel-related needs (1:41 pm on 12 January, 2024).\",\n    \"1:41 pm on 12 January, 2024: John praised Tim for taking initiative, stating it is a must if one wants to achieve their goals (originally stated as 1:41 pm on 12 January, 2024).\",\n    \"1:41 pm on 12 January, 2024: Tim said goodbye to John (1:41 pm on 12 January, 2024).\",\n    \"1:41 pm on 12 January, 2024: Tim says he owes John one and offers to help him in return (1:41 pm on 12 January, 2024).\",\n    \"6:59 pm on 26 August, 2023: John offered to help Tim with planning his visit to NYC\",\n    \"8:17 pm on 21 September, 2023: John asked Tim for book recommendations for his trip (discussed on 2023-09-21).\",\n    \"8:17 pm on 21 September, 2023: Tim advised John to pick endorsements that align with his values and brand and feel authentic to his followers (discussed on 2023-09-21).\",\n    \"3:35 pm on 26 December, 2023: John offered to help Tim when they let him know about their plans (on 26 August, 2023 at 6:59 pm).
