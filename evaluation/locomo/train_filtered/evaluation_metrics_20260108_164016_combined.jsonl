{"data_source": "evaluation_metrics_20260108_164016_combined", "prompt": [{"content": "\n    You are an intelligent memory assistant tasked with retrieving accurate information from conversation memories.\n\n    # CONTEXT:\n    You have access to memories from two speakers in a conversation. These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references unless instructed to keep them.\n\n    Memories for user Audrey:\n\n    [\n    \"1:10 pm on 27 March, 2023: Andrew asked to see a picture of Audrey's dogs\",\n    \"5:41 pm on 3 May, 2023: Audrey mentioned that she went on a hike last week and had an amazing experience with a hummingbird; image: https://images.pexels.com/photos/7875455/pexels-photo-7875455.jpeg; title: a photography of a hummingbird sitting on a branch with its wings spread\",\n    \"2:03 pm on 11 May, 2023: Audrey met a friendly and playful dog from the pet store volunteer\",\n    \"2:03 pm on 11 May, 2023: Audrey heard about the workshop from a flyer at her local pet store\",\n    \"12:24 am on 24 August, 2023: Audrey has never been fishing before.\",\n    \"7:49 pm on 6 September, 2023: Audrey said she was happy to see her dogs have a great time during a doggy playdate she organized with the neighbors' dogs (originally stated as 'Something cool recently happened with my furry friends - I organized a doggy playdate with the neighbors' dogs.

{"data_source": "evaluation_metrics_20260108_164016_combined", "prompt": [{"content": "\n    You are an intelligent memory assistant tasked with retrieving accurate information from conversation memories.\n\n    # CONTEXT:\n    You have access to memories from two speakers in a conversation. These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references unless instructed to keep them.\n\n    Memories for user Audrey:\n\n    [\n    \"12:24 am on 24 August, 2023: Andrew and his girlfriend went fishing in a nearby lake last weekend (originally stated as last weekend relative to 2023-08-24).\",\n    \"12:24 am on 24 August, 2023: - Andrew and his girlfriend went fishing at a nearby lake and enjoyed the experience.\\n- Audrey has never fished but loves spending time at lakes with her dogs, emphasizing the importance of regular grooming and bonding.\\n- Audrey shared a photo of her dogs at a mountain lake, and Andrew shared a photo of Toby, a small dog, with a leash.\\n- Audrey offered to help Andrew with tips on caring for Toby, and Andrew expressed gratitude and excitement for bonding with Toby outdoors.\",\n    \"3:52 pm on 27 July, 2023: Andrew said he and his girlfriend went volunteering with animals because it is their way of giving back and making their lives better.\",\n    \"2:36 pm on 28 October, 2023: Andrew mentioned that he has a picnic date with his girlfriend on Sunday.\",\n    \"1:10 pm on 27 March, 2023: Andrew does not currently have any pets but loves animals\",\n    \"3:52 pm on 27 July, 2023: Andrew and his girlfriend volunteered at a pet shelter on Monday (originally stated as Monday relative to 2023-07-27, i.e., 2023-07-24).\",\n    \"10:14 am on 24 October, 2023: Andrew and his girlfriend attended a wine tasting last weekend (originally stated as last weekend relative to 2023-10-24, i.e., 2023-10-22) and found it great, trying many unique wines and learning a lot; image: https://i.redd.it/1jjc5bw9tmgb1.jpg; title: a photo of a person with a cast on their arm and arm in a cast\",\n    \"9:58 pm on 16 August, 2023: Andrew and his girlfriend enjoy discovering new places to eat around town as a way to try something new and wind down after a long week.

These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6.

{"data_source": "evaluation_metrics_20260108_164016_combined", "prompt": [{"content": "\n    You are an intelligent memory assistant tasked with retrieving accurate information from conversation memories.\n\n    # CONTEXT:\n    You have access to memories from two speakers in a conversation. These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references unless instructed to keep them.\n\n    Memories for user Audrey:\n\n    [\n    \"1:10 pm on 27 March, 2023: Audrey's dogs enjoy exploring new parks and trails in the city\",\n    \"8:32 pm on 3 July, 2023: Andrew asked what breed Audrey's dogs are and what they enjoy doing the most.\",\n    \"5:23 pm on 13 June, 2023: Andrew expressed interest in joining Audrey and her dogs for a walk in the park.\",\n    \"10:47 am on 6 May, 2023: Audrey has a park near her and takes her dogs there for walks.\",\n    \"8:32 pm on 3 July, 2023: Audrey said her dogs love running and playing fetch.\",\n    \"7:09 pm on 1 October, 2023: Audrey took her dogs to the dog park nearby last Saturday (originally stated as last Saturday relative to 2023-10-01, i.e., 2023-09-23).

These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7.
