These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories from both speakers\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps to determine the answer\n    3. If the question asks about a specific event or fact, look for direct evidence in the memories\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory\n    5. If there is a question about time references (like \"last year\", \"two months ago\", etc.), \n       calculate the actual date based on the memory timestamp. For example, if a memory from \n       4 May 2022 mentions \"went to India last year,\" then the trip occurred in 2021.\n    6. Always convert relative time references to specific dates, months, or years. For example, \n       convert \"last year\" to \"2022\" or \"two months ago\" to \"March 2023\" based on the memory \n       timestamp. Ignore the reference while answering the question.\n    7.

Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question\n    4. If the answer requires calculation (e.g., converting relative time references), show your work\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories\n    6.

If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory\n    5. If there is a question about time references (like \"last year\", \"two months ago\", etc.), \n       calculate the actual date based on the memory timestamp. For example, if a memory from \n       4 May 2022 mentions \"went to India last year,\" then the trip occurred in 2021.\n    6. Always convert relative time references to specific dates, months, or years. For example, \n       convert \"last year\" to \"2022\" or \"two months ago\" to \"March 2023\" based on the memory \n       timestamp. Ignore the reference while answering the question.\n    7. Focus only on the content of the memories from both speakers. Do not confuse character \n       names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n    8. The answer should be less than 5-6 words.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question\n    4. If the answer requires calculation (e.g., converting relative time references), show your work\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked\n    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references\n\n    Memories for user John:\n\n    [\n    \"11:08 am on 16 August, 2023: Maria spent some time at the shelter volunteering at the front desk last Friday (time relative to a specific day: 'Last Friday (originally stated as Last Friday relative to 2023-08-16, i.e., 2023-08-11)').\",\n    \"5:04 pm on 6 May, 2023: Maria joined a nearby church just yesterday (originally stated as 'just yesterday', i.e., 2023-05-05) to feel closer to a community and her faith.\",\n    \"6:03 pm on 6 March, 2023: Maria mentioned that her grandma passed away last week (time relative to a specific day: '6 March, 2023'), and it has been really hard for her.\",\n    \"9:36 am on 2 April, 2023: Maria and John volunteered together last year (last year relative to 2023, i.e., 2022).\",\n    \"7:20 pm on 16 June, 2023: Maria joined a gym last week (time relative to a specific day: 'last week')\",\n    \"12:24 am on 7 April, 2023: Maria participated in a 5K charity run for a homeless shelter last weekend and found it inspiring and rewarding\",\n    \"8:06 pm on 9 August, 2023: Last week (originally stated as last week relative to 2023-08-09, i.e., 2023-08-02), Maria volunteered at the homeless shelter and was given a medal; image: https://images.rawpixel.com/image_800/czNmcy1wcml2YXRlL3Jhd3BpeGVsX2ltYWdlcy93ZWJzaXRlX2NvbnRlbnQvbHIvZnJ3aW5uZXJfZ29sZF9wcm9maXRfYXdhcmQtaW1hZ2Uta3liY2R6bjguanBn.jpg; title: a photography of a medal hanging from a tree with a ribbon.\",\n    \"3:34 pm on 17 July, 2023: Maria had a picnic last weekend (time relative to a specific day: 'last weekend') with some friends from church.

These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories from both speakers\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps to determine the answer\n    3. If the question asks about a specific event or fact, look for direct evidence in the memories\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory\n    5. If there is a question about time references (like \"last year\", \"two months ago\", etc.), \n       calculate the actual date based on the memory timestamp. For example, if a memory from \n       4 May 2022 mentions \"went to India last year,\" then the trip occurred in 2021.\n    6. Always convert relative time references to specific dates, months, or years.

If the answer requires calculation (e.g., converting relative time references), show your work\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories\n    6.

For example, if a memory from \n       4 May 2022 mentions \"went to India last year,\" then the trip occurred in 2021.\n    6.
