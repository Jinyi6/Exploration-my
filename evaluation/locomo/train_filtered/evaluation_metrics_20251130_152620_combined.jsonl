If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory\n    5. If there is a question about time references (like \"last year\", \"two months ago\", etc.), \n       calculate the actual date based on the memory timestamp. For example, if a memory from \n       4 May 2022 mentions \"went to India last year,\" then the trip occurred in 2021.\n    6. Always convert relative time references to specific dates, months, or years.

The answer should be less than 5-6 words.\n    9. When you can’t find evidence, the question may be an inference question. In that case, use common sense and reasoning to answer—don’t refuse.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question\n    4. If the answer requires calculation (e.g., converting relative time references), show your work\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked\n    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references\n\n    **Note. Time Calculation (Simplified Rules):**\n    \n    * **Pre-check for date questions**: Before writing the final answer, verify that your handling of time expressions follows the rules below.\n    \n    * **Weekday-based expressions** (e.g., \"last Friday\", \"this Tuesday\", \"next weekend\"): **never compute an absolute calendar date**. Answer using a **relative phrase anchored to the memory’s timestamp**.\n    \n      **Standard format QA examples:**\n    \n      * **Q:** The memory (timestamp **14 August 2023**) says the event was **“last Friday.”** How should I state the time?\n        **A:** **“last Friday before 14 August 2023.”**\n      * **Q:** The memory (timestamp **17 July 2023**) mentions **“this Tuesday.”** How should I state the time?\n        **A:** **“the Tuesday after 17 July 2023.”**\n    \n    * **Non-weekday relative expressions** that can be computed **without calendar lookup** (e.g., \"yesterday\", \"last month\", \"last year\"): you **may convert** to an absolute value when the year/month/day can be derived directly from the timestamp.\n    \n    QA examples (memory timestamp: 2023-08-14):\n    \n    Q: What is “yesterday”?\n    A: 2023-08-13\n    (Anti-example ❌: yesterday of 2023-08-13.”**)\n    Q: What is “last month”?\n    A: 2023-07\n    (Anti-example ❌: last month of 2023-08.”**)\n    Q: What is “last year”?\n    A: 2022\n    (Anti-example ❌: last year of 2023.”**)\n    * **Time granularity**: Do not over-specify. Keep vague phrases (\"last week\", \"recently\", \"a few months ago\") as-is and anchor them to the timestamp.\n    Q: The memory says “last week.” What date is that?\n    A: Do **not** compute exact dates.

These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories from both speakers\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps to determine the answer\n    3. If the question asks about a specific event or fact, look for direct evidence in the memories\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory\n    5. If there is a question about time references (like \"last year\", \"two months ago\", etc.), \n       calculate the actual date based on the memory timestamp. For example, if a memory from \n       4 May 2022 mentions \"went to India last year,\" then the trip occurred in 2021.\n    6. Always convert relative time references to specific dates, months, or years. For example, \n       convert \"last year\" to \"2022\" or \"two months ago\" to \"March 2023\" based on the memory \n       timestamp. Ignore the reference while answering the question.\n    7.

In that case, use common sense and reasoning to answer—don’t refuse.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully\n    3.

Time Calculation (Simplified Rules):**\n    \n    * **Pre-check for date questions**: Before writing the final answer, verify that your handling of time expressions follows the rules below.\n    \n    * **Weekday-based expressions** (e.g., \"last Friday\", \"this Tuesday\", \"next weekend\"): **never compute an absolute calendar date**. Answer using a **relative phrase anchored to the memory’s timestamp**.\n    \n      **Standard format QA examples:**\n    \n      * **Q:** The memory (timestamp **14 August 2023**) says the event was **“last Friday.”** How should I state the time?\n        **A:** **“last Friday before 14 August 2023.”**\n      * **Q:** The memory (timestamp **17 July 2023**) mentions **“this Tuesday.”** How should I state the time?\n        **A:** **“the Tuesday after 17 July 2023.”**\n    \n    * **Non-weekday relative expressions** that can be computed **without calendar lookup** (e.g., \"yesterday\", \"last month\", \"last year\"): you **may convert** to an absolute value when the year/month/day can be derived directly from the timestamp.\n    \n    QA examples (memory timestamp: 2023-08-14):\n    \n    Q: What is “yesterday”?\n    A: 2023-08-13\n    (Anti-example ❌: yesterday of 2023-08-13.”**)\n    Q: What is “last month”?\n    A: 2023-07\n    (Anti-example ❌: last month of 2023-08.”**)\n    Q: What is “last year”?\n    A: 2022\n    (Anti-example ❌: last year of 2023.”**)\n    * **Time granularity**: Do not over-specify. Keep vague phrases (\"last week\", \"recently\", \"a few months ago\") as-is and anchor them to the timestamp.\n    Q: The memory says “last week.” What date is that?\n    A: Do **not** compute exact dates.

These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories from both speakers\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps to determine the answer\n    3. If the question asks about a specific event or fact, look for direct evidence in the memories\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory\n    5. If there is a question about time references (like \"last year\", \"two months ago\", etc.), \n       calculate the actual date based on the memory timestamp. For example, if a memory from \n       4 May 2022 mentions \"went to India last year,\" then the trip occurred in 2021.\n    6. Always convert relative time references to specific dates, months, or years. For example, \n       convert \"last year\" to \"2022\" or \"two months ago\" to \"March 2023\" based on the memory \n       timestamp. Ignore the reference while answering the question.\n    7. Focus only on the content of the memories from both speakers. Do not confuse character \n       names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n    8. The answer should be less than 5-6 words.\n    9. When you can’t find evidence, the question may be an inference question. In that case, use common sense and reasoning to answer—don’t refuse.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question\n    4. If the answer requires calculation (e.g., converting relative time references), show your work\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories\n    6.

Pay special attention to the timestamps to determine the answer\n    3. If the question asks about a specific event or fact, look for direct evidence in the memories\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory\n    5. If there is a question about time references (like \"last year\", \"two months ago\", etc.), \n       calculate the actual date based on the memory timestamp.

If there is a question about time references (like \"last year\", \"two months ago\", etc.), \n       calculate the actual date based on the memory timestamp. For example, if a memory from \n       4 May 2022 mentions \"went to India last year,\" then the trip occurred in 2021.\n    6. Always convert relative time references to specific dates, months, or years. For example, \n       convert \"last year\" to \"2022\" or \"two months ago\" to \"March 2023\" based on the memory \n       timestamp. Ignore the reference while answering the question.\n    7. Focus only on the content of the memories from both speakers. Do not confuse character \n       names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n    8. The answer should be less than 5-6 words.\n    9. When you can’t find evidence, the question may be an inference question. In that case, use common sense and reasoning to answer—don’t refuse.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question\n    4. If the answer requires calculation (e.g., converting relative time references), show your work\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked\n    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references\n\n    **Note. Time Calculation (Simplified Rules):**\n    \n    * **Pre-check for date questions**: Before writing the final answer, verify that your handling of time expressions follows the rules below.\n    \n    * **Weekday-based expressions** (e.g., \"last Friday\", \"this Tuesday\", \"next weekend\"): **never compute an absolute calendar date**. Answer using a **relative phrase anchored to the memory’s timestamp**.\n    \n      **Standard format QA examples:**\n    \n      * **Q:** The memory (timestamp **14 August 2023**) says the event was **“last Friday.”** How should I state the time?\n        **A:** **“last Friday before 14 August 2023.”**\n      * **Q:** The memory (timestamp **17 July 2023**) mentions **“this Tuesday.”** How should I state the time?\n        **A:** **“the Tuesday after 17 July 2023.”**\n    \n    * **Non-weekday relative expressions** that can be computed **without calendar lookup** (e.g., \"yesterday\", \"last month\", \"last year\"): you **may convert** to an absolute value when the year/month/day can be derived directly from the timestamp.\n    \n    QA examples (memory timestamp: 2023-08-14):\n    \n    Q: What is “yesterday”?\n    A: 2023-08-13\n    (Anti-example ❌: yesterday of 2023-08-13.”**)\n    Q: What is “last month”?\n    A: 2023-07\n    (Anti-example ❌: last month of 2023-08.”**)\n    Q: What is “last year”?\n    A: 2022\n    (Anti-example ❌: last year of 2023.”**)\n    * **Time granularity**: Do not over-specify. Keep vague phrases (\"last week\", \"recently\", \"a few months ago\") as-is and anchor them to the timestamp.\n    Q: The memory says “last week.” What date is that?\n    A: Do **not** compute exact dates. Answer as **“last week before 2023-08-14.”**\n    (Anti-example ❌: specifying exact dates like **“2023-08-07 to 2023-08-13.”**)\n\n    * **Conversation time vs. event time**: Distinguish carefully. If the question asks **when the event happened**, do not answer with the conversation time.\n    \n      **QA example (two memories):**\n      *Memory A (timestamp **14 August 2023**): “Went to the city **last Friday**.”*\n      *Memory B (timestamp **16 August 2023**): “**Will go again next Tuesday.**”*\n    \n      **Q:** When did they go to the city?\n      **A:** **“last Friday before 14 August 2023.”**\n      **Anti-examples ❌:**\n      • “On **16 August 2023**” (this is the conversation/memory time, not the event time).\n    * **Tense**: Ensure past/future tense matches the event.\n      **Anti-examples ❌:**\n      • “They went last Friday **and will go again next Tuesday**” (the question asks only about the past event).\n    \n    Memories for user James:\n\n    [\n    \"9:23 pm on 4 September, 2022: James prepared several simple dishes at the first lesson of the cooking class.\",\n    \"9:23 pm on 4 September, 2022: James made a great omelette the first time at the cooking class.\",\n    \"9:23 pm on 4 September, 2022: James also made meringue at the cooking class.\",\n    \"9:23 pm on 4 September, 2022: James signed up for a cooking class two days ago (originally stated as two days ago relative to 2022-09-04, i.e., 2022-08-31).\",\n    \"9:23 pm on 4 September, 2022: James hopes to treat John to his cooking creations once he learns more about cooking.\",\n    \"9:23 pm on 4 September, 2022: John looks forward to tasting James's cooking creations and encourages him.\",\n    \"9:23 pm on 4 September, 2022: John expressed surprise at James's desire to cook.\",\n    \"12:40 am on 27 March, 2022: James is learning an instrument and described the journey as challenging but rewarding\",\n    \"4:30 pm on 13 June, 2022: John asked James if he chose the course because he loves football.\",\n    \"3:47 pm on 17 March, 2022: John asked James what motivates him to work on his programming projects\",\n    \"3:47 pm on 17 March, 2022: James wished good luck in the class and asked if the user has any coding experience.\",\n    \"3:47 pm on 17 March, 2022: James said programming is an awesome skill and that he tried it out in college and now it's all his life.\",\n    \"3:57 pm on 21 August, 2022: James asked if John is returning to working with programming again\",\n    \"12:40 am on 27 March, 2022: James mentioned he has been practicing the instrument daily and seeing improvements\",\n    \"6:02 pm on 18 September, 2022: John asked James how he came up with his ideas and where he gets them from\",\n    \"6:02 pm on 18 September, 2022: James said he gets ideas from various sources like books, movies, and even dreams\",\n    \"9:32 pm on 20 April, 2022: James visited Italy last year.

{"data_source": "evaluation_metrics_20251130_152620_combined", "prompt": [{"content": "\n    You are an intelligent memory assistant tasked with retrieving accurate information from conversation memories.\n\n    # CONTEXT:\n    You have access to memories from two speakers in a conversation. These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories from both speakers\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps to determine the answer\n    3. If the question asks about a specific event or fact, look for direct evidence in the memories\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory\n    5. If there is a question about time references (like \"last year\", \"two months ago\", etc.), \n       calculate the actual date based on the memory timestamp. For example, if a memory from \n       4 May 2022 mentions \"went to India last year,\" then the trip occurred in 2021.\n    6. Always convert relative time references to specific dates, months, or years. For example, \n       convert \"last year\" to \"2022\" or \"two months ago\" to \"March 2023\" based on the memory \n       timestamp. Ignore the reference while answering the question.\n    7. Focus only on the content of the memories from both speakers. Do not confuse character \n       names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n    8. The answer should be less than 5-6 words.\n    9. When you can’t find evidence, the question may be an inference question. In that case, use common sense and reasoning to answer—don’t refuse.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question\n    4. If the answer requires calculation (e.g., converting relative time references), show your work\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked\n    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references\n\n    **Note. Time Calculation (Simplified Rules):**\n    \n    * **Pre-check for date questions**: Before writing the final answer, verify that your handling of time expressions follows the rules below.\n    \n    * **Weekday-based expressions** (e.g., \"last Friday\", \"this Tuesday\", \"next weekend\"): **never compute an absolute calendar date**. Answer using a **relative phrase anchored to the memory’s timestamp**.\n    \n      **Standard format QA examples:**\n    \n      * **Q:** The memory (timestamp **14 August 2023**) says the event was **“last Friday.”** How should I state the time?\n        **A:** **“last Friday before 14 August 2023.”**\n      * **Q:** The memory (timestamp **17 July 2023**) mentions **“this Tuesday.”** How should I state the time?\n        **A:** **“the Tuesday after 17 July 2023.”**\n    \n    * **Non-weekday relative expressions** that can be computed **without calendar lookup** (e.g., \"yesterday\", \"last month\", \"last year\"): you **may convert** to an absolute value when the year/month/day can be derived directly from the timestamp.\n    \n    QA examples (memory timestamp: 2023-08-14):\n    \n    Q: What is “yesterday”?\n    A: 2023-08-13\n    (Anti-example ❌: yesterday of 2023-08-13.”**)\n    Q: What is “last month”?\n    A: 2023-07\n    (Anti-example ❌: last month of 2023-08.”**)\n    Q: What is “last year”?\n    A: 2022\n    (Anti-example ❌: last year of 2023.”**)\n    * **Time granularity**: Do not over-specify. Keep vague phrases (\"last week\", \"recently\", \"a few months ago\") as-is and anchor them to the timestamp.\n    Q: The memory says “last week.” What date is that?\n    A: Do **not** compute exact dates. Answer as **“last week before 2023-08-14.”**\n    (Anti-example ❌: specifying exact dates like **“2023-08-07 to 2023-08-13.”**)\n\n    * **Conversation time vs. event time**: Distinguish carefully.

For example, if a memory from \n       4 May 2022 mentions \"went to India last year,\" then the trip occurred in 2021.\n    6. Always convert relative time references to specific dates, months, or years. For example, \n       convert \"last year\" to \"2022\" or \"two months ago\" to \"March 2023\" based on the memory \n       timestamp. Ignore the reference while answering the question.\n    7. Focus only on the content of the memories from both speakers. Do not confuse character \n       names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n    8. The answer should be less than 5-6 words.\n    9. When you can’t find evidence, the question may be an inference question. In that case, use common sense and reasoning to answer—don’t refuse.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question\n    4. If the answer requires calculation (e.g., converting relative time references), show your work\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked\n    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references\n\n    **Note.

These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories from both speakers\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps to determine the answer\n    3. If the question asks about a specific event or fact, look for direct evidence in the memories\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory\n    5. If there is a question about time references (like \"last year\", \"two months ago\", etc.), \n       calculate the actual date based on the memory timestamp. For example, if a memory from \n       4 May 2022 mentions \"went to India last year,\" then the trip occurred in 2021.\n    6. Always convert relative time references to specific dates, months, or years.

These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories from both speakers\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps to determine the answer\n    3. If the question asks about a specific event or fact, look for direct evidence in the memories\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory\n    5. If there is a question about time references (like \"last year\", \"two months ago\", etc.), \n       calculate the actual date based on the memory timestamp. For example, if a memory from \n       4 May 2022 mentions \"went to India last year,\" then the trip occurred in 2021.\n    6. Always convert relative time references to specific dates, months, or years. For example, \n       convert \"last year\" to \"2022\" or \"two months ago\" to \"March 2023\" based on the memory \n       timestamp. Ignore the reference while answering the question.\n    7. Focus only on the content of the memories from both speakers. Do not confuse character \n       names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n    8. The answer should be less than 5-6 words.\n    9. When you can’t find evidence, the question may be an inference question. In that case, use common sense and reasoning to answer—don’t refuse.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully\n    3.

{"data_source": "evaluation_metrics_20251130_152620_combined", "prompt": [{"content": "\n    You are an intelligent memory assistant tasked with retrieving accurate information from conversation memories.\n\n    # CONTEXT:\n    You have access to memories from two speakers in a conversation. These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories from both speakers\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps to determine the answer\n    3. If the question asks about a specific event or fact, look for direct evidence in the memories\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory\n    5. If there is a question about time references (like \"last year\", \"two months ago\", etc.), \n       calculate the actual date based on the memory timestamp. For example, if a memory from \n       4 May 2022 mentions \"went to India last year,\" then the trip occurred in 2021.\n    6. Always convert relative time references to specific dates, months, or years. For example, \n       convert \"last year\" to \"2022\" or \"two months ago\" to \"March 2023\" based on the memory \n       timestamp. Ignore the reference while answering the question.\n    7. Focus only on the content of the memories from both speakers. Do not confuse character \n       names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n    8. The answer should be less than 5-6 words.\n    9. When you can’t find evidence, the question may be an inference question. In that case, use common sense and reasoning to answer—don’t refuse.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question\n    4. If the answer requires calculation (e.g., converting relative time references), show your work\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked\n    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references\n\n    **Note. Time Calculation (Simplified Rules):**\n    \n    * **Pre-check for date questions**: Before writing the final answer, verify that your handling of time expressions follows the rules below.\n    \n    * **Weekday-based expressions** (e.g., \"last Friday\", \"this Tuesday\", \"next weekend\"): **never compute an absolute calendar date**. Answer using a **relative phrase anchored to the memory’s timestamp**.\n    \n      **Standard format QA examples:**\n    \n      * **Q:** The memory (timestamp **14 August 2023**) says the event was **“last Friday.”** How should I state the time?\n        **A:** **“last Friday before 14 August 2023.”**\n      * **Q:** The memory (timestamp **17 July 2023**) mentions **“this Tuesday.”** How should I state the time?\n        **A:** **“the Tuesday after 17 July 2023.”**\n    \n    * **Non-weekday relative expressions** that can be computed **without calendar lookup** (e.g., \"yesterday\", \"last month\", \"last year\"): you **may convert** to an absolute value when the year/month/day can be derived directly from the timestamp.\n    \n    QA examples (memory timestamp: 2023-08-14):\n    \n    Q: What is “yesterday”?\n    A: 2023-08-13\n    (Anti-example ❌: yesterday of 2023-08-13.”**)\n    Q: What is “last month”?\n    A: 2023-07\n    (Anti-example ❌: last month of 2023-08.”**)\n    Q: What is “last year”?\n    A: 2022\n    (Anti-example ❌: last year of 2023.”**)\n    * **Time granularity**: Do not over-specify. Keep vague phrases (\"last week\", \"recently\", \"a few months ago\") as-is and anchor them to the timestamp.\n    Q: The memory says “last week.” What date is that?\n    A: Do **not** compute exact dates. Answer as **“last week before 2023-08-14.”**\n    (Anti-example ❌: specifying exact dates like **“2023-08-07 to 2023-08-13.”**)\n\n    * **Conversation time vs. event time**: Distinguish carefully. If the question asks **when the event happened**, do not answer with the conversation time.\n    \n      **QA example (two memories):**\n      *Memory A (timestamp **14 August 2023**): “Went to the city **last Friday**.”*\n      *Memory B (timestamp **16 August 2023**): “**Will go again next Tuesday.**”*\n    \n      **Q:** When did they go to the city?\n      **A:** **“last Friday before 14 August 2023.”**\n      **Anti-examples ❌:**\n      • “On **16 August 2023**” (this is the conversation/memory time, not the event time).\n    * **Tense**: Ensure past/future tense matches the event.\n      **Anti-examples ❌:**\n      • “They went last Friday **and will go again next Tuesday**” (the question asks only about the past event).\n    \n    Memories for user James:\n\n    [\n    \"7:01 pm on 4 May, 2022: John asked James what type of dogs they are.\",\n    \"8:57 pm on 7 November, 2022: John stated the dog's name is Luna.\",\n    \"1:45 pm on 6 August, 2022: John asked what happened to James's puppy and if it is okay.\",\n    \"8:57 pm on 7 November, 2022: John asked James if he felt tempted to bring any furry pals home after visiting the animal sanctuary\",\n    \"8:57 pm on 7 November, 2022: John appreciates the daily dose of positivity from dogs and refers to them as special buddies.\",\n    \"9:18 pm on 26 August, 2022: John asked James to remind him of his dog's name, Ned, and mentioned that he has been helping his younger siblings with programming since they joined a programming course.\",\n    \"8:57 pm on 7 November, 2022: John asked James to share more about the visit to the animal sanctuary\",\n    \"1:45 pm on 6 August, 2022: John expressed relief that the puppy is okay and praised James for caring so much about his pets.\",\n    \"8:57 pm on 7 November, 2022: John shared an image of his cousin's dog sitting on a rug in front of a couch; image: https://i.redd.it/iwwwkzul10b71.jpg; title: a photo of a dog sitting on a rug in front of a couch\",\n    \"8:57 pm on 7 November, 2022: John believes having a dog brings joy and love, comparing it to having sunshine on a cloudy day.\",\n    \"8:57 pm on 7 November, 2022: John said dogs are awesome and make us feel loved and cheerful.\",\n    \"5:07 pm on 16 June, 2022: John asked James about the name of the dog in a picture from his Facebook, describing it as cute; image: https://i.redd.it/gnwdz3ysqra71.jpg; title: a photo of a dog sitting on a couch in a living room.\",\n    \"8:57 pm on 7 November, 2022: James found the dog adorable and asked for its name.\",\n    \"9:49 am on 22 July, 2022: John mentioned that they don't have pets currently but will definitely get one someday.\",\n    \"1:45 pm on 6 August, 2022: John's new job aligns with his values and passions\",\n    \"9:26 pm on 20 March, 2022: John said the dogs are adorable and mentioned wanting a pet someday (originally stated as 'Aww, they're adorable!
