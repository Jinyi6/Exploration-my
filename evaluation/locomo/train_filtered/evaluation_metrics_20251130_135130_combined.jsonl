These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories from both speakers\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps to determine the answer\n    3. If the question asks about a specific event or fact, look for direct evidence in the memories\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory\n    5. If there is a question about time references (like \"last year\", \"two months ago\", etc.), \n       calculate the actual date based on the memory timestamp. For example, if a memory from \n       4 May 2022 mentions \"went to India last year,\" then the trip occurred in 2021.\n    6. Always convert relative time references to specific dates, months, or years. For example, \n       convert \"last year\" to \"2022\" or \"two months ago\" to \"March 2023\" based on the memory \n       timestamp. Ignore the reference while answering the question.\n    7. Focus only on the content of the memories from both speakers. Do not confuse character \n       names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n    8. The answer should be less than 5-6 words.\n    9. When you can’t find evidence, the question may be an inference question. In that case, use common sense and reasoning to answer—don’t refuse.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully\n    3.

{"data_source": "evaluation_metrics_20251130_135130_combined", "prompt": [{"content": "\n    You are an intelligent memory assistant tasked with retrieving accurate information from conversation memories.\n\n    # CONTEXT:\n    You have access to memories from two speakers in a conversation. These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories from both speakers\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps to determine the answer\n    3. If the question asks about a specific event or fact, look for direct evidence in the memories\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory\n    5. If there is a question about time references (like \"last year\", \"two months ago\", etc.), \n       calculate the actual date based on the memory timestamp. For example, if a memory from \n       4 May 2022 mentions \"went to India last year,\" then the trip occurred in 2021.\n    6. Always convert relative time references to specific dates, months, or years. For example, \n       convert \"last year\" to \"2022\" or \"two months ago\" to \"March 2023\" based on the memory \n       timestamp. Ignore the reference while answering the question.\n    7. Focus only on the content of the memories from both speakers. Do not confuse character \n       names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n    8. The answer should be less than 5-6 words.\n    9. When you can’t find evidence, the question may be an inference question. In that case, use common sense and reasoning to answer—don’t refuse.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question\n    4. If the answer requires calculation (e.g., converting relative time references), show your work\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked\n    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references\n\n    **Note. Time Calculation (Simplified Rules):**\n    \n    * **Pre-check for date questions**: Before writing the final answer, verify that your handling of time expressions follows the rules below.\n    \n    * **Weekday-based expressions** (e.g., \"last Friday\", \"this Tuesday\", \"next weekend\"): **never compute an absolute calendar date**. Answer using a **relative phrase anchored to the memory’s timestamp**.\n    \n      **Standard format QA examples:**\n    \n      * **Q:** The memory (timestamp **14 August 2023**) says the event was **“last Friday.”** How should I state the time?\n        **A:** **“last Friday before 14 August 2023.”**\n      * **Q:** The memory (timestamp **17 July 2023**) mentions **“this Tuesday.”** How should I state the time?\n        **A:** **“the Tuesday after 17 July 2023.”**\n    \n    * **Non-weekday relative expressions** that can be computed **without calendar lookup** (e.g., \"yesterday\", \"last month\", \"last year\"): you **may convert** to an absolute value when the year/month/day can be derived directly from the timestamp.\n    \n    QA examples (memory timestamp: 2023-08-14):\n    \n    Q: What is “yesterday”?\n    A: 2023-08-13\n    (Anti-example ❌: yesterday of 2023-08-13.”**)\n    Q: What is “last month”?\n    A: 2023-07\n    (Anti-example ❌: last month of 2023-08.”**)\n    Q: What is “last year”?\n    A: 2022\n    (Anti-example ❌: last year of 2023.”**)\n    * **Time granularity**: Do not over-specify. Keep vague phrases (\"last week\", \"recently\", \"a few months ago\") as-is and anchor them to the timestamp.\n    Q: The memory says “last week.” What date is that?\n    A: Do **not** compute exact dates. Answer as **“last week before 2023-08-14.”**\n    (Anti-example ❌: specifying exact dates like **“2023-08-07 to 2023-08-13.”**)\n\n    * **Conversation time vs. event time**: Distinguish carefully. If the question asks **when the event happened**, do not answer with the conversation time.\n    \n      **QA example (two memories):**\n      *Memory A (timestamp **14 August 2023**): “Went to the city **last Friday**.”*\n      *Memory B (timestamp **16 August 2023**): “**Will go again next Tuesday.**”*\n    \n      **Q:** When did they go to the city?\n      **A:** **“last Friday before 14 August 2023.”**\n      **Anti-examples ❌:**\n      • “On **16 August 2023**” (this is the conversation/memory time, not the event time).\n    * **Tense**: Ensure past/future tense matches the event.\n      **Anti-examples ❌:**\n      • “They went last Friday **and will go again next Tuesday**” (the question asks only about the past event).\n    \n    Memories for user Jon:\n\n    [\n    \"7:28 pm on 23 March, 2023: Jon asked Gina how her online clothing store was going.\",\n    \"1:26 pm on 3 April, 2023: Gina thanked Jon for his kind words and said her store is going good.\",\n    \"1:26 pm on 3 April, 2023: Gina is not giving up on her business despite the challenges.\",\n    \"7:28 pm on 23 March, 2023: Jon said it's been great and complimented Gina on her store.\",\n    \"7:28 pm on 23 March, 2023: Gina is working at a store and mentions that it is doing great, describing it as a wild ride.\",\n    \"1:26 pm on 3 April, 2023: Gina has some new offers and promotions going on in her online store to bring in new customers.\",\n    \"7:28 pm on 23 March, 2023: Gina mentioned that she's been keeping up with fashion trends to offer the best pieces to customers.\",\n    \"2:35 pm on 16 March, 2023: Gina said she has been having some tough times lately.\",\n    \"2:15 pm on 21 June, 2023: Jon congratulated Gina on her store and expressed happiness for her\",\n    \"9:38 pm on 16 June, 2023: Gina said that she has been an entrepreneur since she lost her job and opened an online clothing store, which has been great for her.\",\n    \"12:48 am on 1 February, 2023: Gina is renovating her store to reflect her personal style and create a cozy atmosphere for customers.\",\n    \"9:38 pm on 16 June, 2023: Gina said that her dance videos are doing well online.\",\n    \"12:48 am on 1 February, 2023: Jon complimented Gina's store and acknowledged her efforts to make it comfortable for customers.\",\n    \"2:15 pm on 21 June, 2023: Jon said that Gina's store looks sick and asked if it was a unique piece she was selling\",\n    \"2:35 pm on 16 March, 2023: Jon congratulated Gina on opening her online clothes store.\",\n    \"12:48 am on 1 February, 2023: Gina considers creating a comfortable and inviting space for her customers as key to her success.\",\n    \"1:26 pm on 3 April, 2023: Gina is definitely in for the show\",\n    \"7:28 pm on 23 March, 2023: Gina thanked Jon for the advice and said she's always working on building relationships and creating a strong brand image for her store.\",\n    \"1:26 pm on 3 April, 2023: Gina said she is thinking of working with some fashion bloggers and influencers in the next few months to get more attention for her store, and that she is going to do more ads to reach more people.

For example, if a memory from \n       4 May 2022 mentions \"went to India last year,\" then the trip occurred in 2021.\n    6.

If the question asks **when the event happened**, do not answer with the conversation time.\n    \n      **QA example (two memories):**\n      *Memory A (timestamp **14 August 2023**): “Went to the city **last Friday**.”*\n      *Memory B (timestamp **16 August 2023**): “**Will go again next Tuesday.**”*\n    \n      **Q:** When did they go to the city?\n      **A:** **“last Friday before 14 August 2023.”**\n      **Anti-examples ❌:**\n      • “On **16 August 2023**” (this is the conversation/memory time, not the event time).\n    * **Tense**: Ensure past/future tense matches the event.\n      **Anti-examples ❌:**\n      • “They went last Friday **and will go again next Tuesday**” (the question asks only about the past event).\n    \n    Memories for user Jon:\n\n    [\n    \"8:29 pm on 13 June, 2023: Jon is offering one-on-one mentoring and training to dancers in addition to dance classes and workshops.\",\n    \"12:48 am on 1 February, 2023: Jon is following his passion for dance and is searching for a place to open his dance studio.\",\n    \"5:44 pm on 21 July, 2023: Jon is working on an online platform to showcase the dance studio's stuff.\",\n    \"8:29 pm on 13 June, 2023: Jon mentioned he is prepping for his dance studio more than ever.\",\n    \"4:04 pm on 20 January, 2023: Jon is planning to start his own dance studio because he is passionate about dancing and wants to share the joy it brings with others.\",\n    \"10:43 am on 4 February, 2023: Jon is determined to achieve his dreams in dance.\",\n    \"1:26 pm on 3 April, 2023: Jon asked Gina about what she has going for her dance studio.\",\n    \"2:32 pm on 29 January, 2023: Jon is determined to make his dance studio work and believes it will be worth it.\",\n    \"5:44 pm on 21 July, 2023: Jon thanked Gina for the offer and asked for advice on marketing strategies for his dance studio.\",\n    \"2:32 pm on 29 January, 2023: Jon is excited but also nervous about finding the right place and getting everything ready for his dance studio.\",\n    \"5:44 pm on 21 July, 2023: Jon asked for marketing strategy advice to reach his target audience and raise awareness for the dance studio.\",\n    \"3:14 pm on 11 May, 2023: Jon said he loves running his own studio because it gives him freedom to create a space and help dancers of all ages and levels express themselves.\",\n    \"9:32 am on 8 February, 2023: Jon expressed that dancing brings him joy and is passionate about it.\",\n    \"10:43 am on 4 February, 2023: Jon is excited about the competition and hopes to gain recognition from the dance community.\",\n    \"3:14 pm on 11 May, 2023: Jon said he wants to create a place for people to dance and express themselves, which has been a dream of his.\",\n    \"10:43 am on 4 February, 2023: Jon mentions that finding a dance studio location has been challenging but he is determined to find the right spot.\",\n    \"8:29 pm on 13 June, 2023: Jon thanked Gina again and shared that working with young dancers has been inspiring, noting their passion and commitment.
