{"data_source": "evaluation_metrics_20260110_084831_combined", "prompt": [{"content": "\n    You are an intelligent memory assistant tasked with retrieving accurate information from conversation memories.\n\n    # CONTEXT:\n    You have access to memories from two speakers in a conversation. These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories from both speakers\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps to determine the answer\n    3. If the question asks about a specific event or fact, look for direct evidence in the memories\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory\n    5. If there is a question about time references (like \"last year\", \"two months ago\", etc.), \n       calculate the actual date based on the memory timestamp. For example, if a memory from \n       4 May 2022 mentions \"went to India last year,\" then the trip occurred in 2021.\n    6. Always convert relative time references to specific dates, months, or years. For example, \n       convert \"last year\" to \"2022\" or \"two months ago\" to \"March 2023\" based on the memory \n       timestamp. Ignore the reference while answering the question.\n    7. Focus only on the content of the memories from both speakers. Do not confuse character \n       names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n    8. The answer should be less than 5-6 words.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question\n    4. If the answer requires calculation (e.g., converting relative time references), show your work\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked\n    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references\n\n    Memories for user John:\n\n    [\n    \"12:10 am on 11 August, 2023: John shared a photo of Max and himself sitting by a campfire from their camping trip last summer; image: https://i.redd.it/g92z4kf3aph91.jpg; caption: a photo of a dog and a person sitting by a campfire\",\n    \"6:03 pm on 6 March, 2023: John shared that last weekend, they enjoyed the carefree joy at the park.\",\n    \"12:10 am on 11 August, 2023: John described his camping trip with Max as a peaceful and awesome experience where they hiked, swam, and made great memories.\",\n    \"11:51 am on 3 June, 2023: John mentioned that their bond with Max was special and something he cherishes.\",\n    \"11:51 am on 3 June, 2023: John shared a picture of Max sitting in the grass with a leash and described him as peaceful and happy.\",\n    \"3:14 pm on 13 August, 2023: John's family enjoys outdoor activities such as hikes, picnics, and hanging out at the park (mentioned in the conversation).\",\n    \"6:10 pm on 22 December, 2022: John and his family enjoy climbing, sliding, and playing games at the playground, which is an awesome way to connect and have a blast.\",\n    \"7:34 pm on 18 April, 2023: John and his colleagues attended a convention together last month (relative to 2023-04-18, i.e., March 2023) where they connected with like-minded individuals passionate about using tech for good in their community.\",\n    \"9:36 am on 2 April, 2023: John and Maria volunteered together last year, and it was a fulfilling experience (Remember when we volunteered together last year?
