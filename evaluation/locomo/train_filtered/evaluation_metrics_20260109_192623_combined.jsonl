These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories from both speakers\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps to determine the answer\n    3. If the question asks about a specific event or fact, look for direct evidence in the memories\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory\n    5. If there is a question about time references (like \"last year\", \"two months ago\", etc.), \n       calculate the actual date based on the memory timestamp. For example, if a memory from \n       4 May 2022 mentions \"went to India last year,\" then the trip occurred in 2021.\n    6. Always convert relative time references to specific dates, months, or years. For example, \n       convert \"last year\" to \"2022\" or \"two months ago\" to \"March 2023\" based on the memory \n       timestamp. Ignore the reference while answering the question.\n    7.

Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question\n    4. If the answer requires calculation (e.g., converting relative time references), show your work\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked\n    7.

{"data_source": "evaluation_metrics_20260109_192623_combined", "prompt": [{"content": "\n    You are an intelligent memory assistant tasked with retrieving accurate information from conversation memories.\n\n    # CONTEXT:\n    You have access to memories from two speakers in a conversation. These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories from both speakers\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps to determine the answer\n    3. If the question asks about a specific event or fact, look for direct evidence in the memories\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory\n    5. If there is a question about time references (like \"last year\", \"two months ago\", etc.), \n       calculate the actual date based on the memory timestamp. For example, if a memory from \n       4 May 2022 mentions \"went to India last year,\" then the trip occurred in 2021.\n    6. Always convert relative time references to specific dates, months, or years. For example, \n       convert \"last year\" to \"2022\" or \"two months ago\" to \"March 2023\" based on the memory \n       timestamp. Ignore the reference while answering the question.\n    7. Focus only on the content of the memories from both speakers. Do not confuse character \n       names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n    8. The answer should be less than 5-6 words.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question\n    4. If the answer requires calculation (e.g., converting relative time references), show your work\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked\n    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references\n\n    Memories for user Jon:\n\n    [\n    \"9:38 pm on 16 June, 2023: Gina advised Jon to use social media channels and work with influencers for bigger reach.\",\n    \"1:25 pm on 9 July, 2023: Jon plans to stay determined and go full-time with his biz idea.\",\n    \"7:18 pm on 27 May, 2023: Jon is wrapping up his business plan and looking for investors, driven by his passion for the project and belief in its success.\",\n    \"7:18 pm on 27 May, 2023: Jon is currently reading 'The Lean Startup' and hoping it will give him tips for his business.\",\n    \"9:38 pm on 16 June, 2023: Jon asked Gina for tips for marketing.\",\n    \"2:15 pm on 21 June, 2023: Jon mentioned that he chose to go to networking events yesterday (originally stated as yesterday relative to 2023-09-28, i.e., 2023-09-27) to make things happen, despite it being tough and him staying determined and focused\",\n    \"5:44 pm on 21 July, 2023: Gina advised Jon not to be scared to reach out to people in his field for help and contacts, as networking was a lifesaver for her.\",\n    \"2:15 pm on 21 June, 2023: Gina praised Jon for attending networking events, stating it takes guts and drive and encouraged him to keep it up\",\n    \"6:46 pm on 23 July, 2023: Jon has been rehearsing hard and working on business plans, which has been stressful.\",\n    \"1:26 pm on 3 April, 2023: Jon asked Gina if she has plans to grow her customer base.\",\n    \"7:28 pm on 23 March, 2023: Gina asks Jon for advice or tips on running a successful business.\",\n    \"11:24 am on 25 April, 2023: Jon expressed admiration for Gina's courage and asked for advice on staying motivated during tough times in his business project\",\n    \"9:38 pm on 16 June, 2023: Jon praised Gina for her advice and said he won't quit, no matter what, as her encouragement motivates him to keep going.\",\n    \"5:44 pm on 21 July, 2023: Jon asked Gina for advice on how she tackled challenges in her business.\",\n    \"11:24 am on 25 April, 2023: Gina said challenges are awesome for learning and growth and advised Jon to focus on his big goal and why he started his business, as well as to rely on a good support system and have faith in himself\",\n    \"4:04 pm on 20 January, 2023: Jon and Gina plan to go to a dance class and explore new dance moves soon.\",\n    \"7:28 pm on 23 March, 2023: Jon advises Gina that brand identity is key and that she should make sure her brand stands out.\",\n    \"7:28 pm on 23 March, 2023: Jon also suggests that Gina build relationships with her customers and let them know she cares.\",\n    \"1:26 pm on 3 April, 2023: Gina expressed enthusiasm for Jon's event next month and asked what would be happening at it.\",\n    \"1:26 pm on 3 April, 2023: Jon expressed excitement about seeing Gina at the event.\",\n    \"10:43 am on 4 February, 2023: Gina encourages Jon, saying he has drive, skills, passion, and her full support, and that he will make a splash.\",\n    \"7:28 pm on 23 March, 2023: Gina encourages Jon to believe in himself and says he got this, urging him to keep going.\",\n    \"8:29 pm on 13 June, 2023: Jon explained that he uses it to stay organized and motivated, setting goals, tracking achievements, and finding areas to improve.\",\n    \"1:26 pm on 3 April, 2023: Jon shared that he is expanding his dance studio's social media presence, offering workshops and classes to local schools and centers, and hosting a dance competition next month to showcase local talent and bring more attention to his studio.
