Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references unless instructed to keep them.\n\n    Memories for user Caroline:\n\n    [\n    \"2:31 pm on 17 July, 2023: Caroline and the teenager she mentors attended an LGBT pride event in June 2023 (originally stated as last month relative to July 2023, i.e., June 2023).\",\n    \"10:37 am on 27 June, 2023: Caroline is 28 years old (based on receiving a bowl for her 18th birthday ten years ago).\",\n    \"1:33 pm on 25 August, 2023: Caroline has been busy with painting.\",\n    \"1:50 pm on 17 August, 2023: Caroline and Melanie attended a Pride festival with a group of friends in 2022 (originally stated as last year relative to 2023); image: https://media2.fdncms.com/portmerc/imager/u/large/46577490/pride2022-2-jankowski.jpg; title: a photo of a group of people walking down a street with balloons.\",\n    \"2:24 pm on 14 August, 2023: Caroline attended a pride parade last Friday (time relative to a specific day: 'last Friday') and described it as having great energy and love.\",\n    \"1:51 pm on 15 July, 2023: Caroline attended a pride parade a few weeks ago (time relative to a specific day: 'a few weeks ago'); image: https://dynaimage.cdn.cnn.com/cnn/digital-images/org/dfc95f14-b325-431c-b977-5b6dc2d35f9c.jpg; title: a photo of a parade with people walking down the street\",\n    \"4:33 pm on 12 July, 2023: Caroline attended an LGBTQ conference on July 10 2023 (originally stated as two days ago relative to July 12 2023).\",\n    \"1:51 pm on 15 July, 2023: Caroline considers the pride parade she attended a few weeks ago to be a special memory (time relative to a specific day: 'a few weeks ago').\",\n    \"1:56 pm on 8 May, 2023: Caroline attended an LGBTQ support group on May 7 2023 (originally stated as yesterday relative to May 8 2023).\",\n    \"8:56 pm on 20 July, 2023: Caroline's city held a pride parade last weekend (time relative to a specific day: 'last weekend').\",\n    \"1:36 pm on 3 July, 2023: Caroline attended an LGBTQ+ pride parade last week (time relative to a specific day: 'last week').\",\n    \"8:56 pm on 20 July, 2023: Caroline missed the pride parade held in her city last weekend (time relative to a specific day: 'last weekend').\",\n    \"1:36 pm on 3 July, 2023: Caroline felt a sense of belonging and was amazed by the growth of the LGBTQ+ community during the pride parade.\",\n    \"2:24 pm on 14 August, 2023: The pride parade reminded Caroline of the importance of standing up for equality.\",\n    \"2:24 pm on 14 August, 2023: The experience at the pride parade motivated Caroline to continue fighting for LGBTQ rights.\",\n    \"1:36 pm on 3 July, 2023: Caroline is going to a transgender conference in July 2023 (originally stated as this month relative to July 2023).\",\n    \"8:56 pm on 20 July, 2023: Caroline believes the pride parade was a powerful reminder that they are not alone in the fight for equality and inclusivity.\",\n    \"2:24 pm on 14 August, 2023: Caroline felt inspired by the pride parade and the diverse crowd celebrating love and acceptance.\",\n    \"1:56 pm on 8 May, 2023: Caroline's LGBTQ support group experience (canonical summary): Attended on May 7 2023, found it powerful, was inspired by transgender stories, felt happy and thankful, and gained the courage to embrace herself.\",\n    \"2:31 pm on 17 July, 2023: The best part of the pride event for Caroline was seeing her mentee's face light up when they saw the support.\",\n    \"1:33 pm on 25 August, 2023: Caroline discovered a vibrant rainbow sidewalk in her neighborhood while walking during Pride Month (vague time expression: 'Pride Month') and took a photograph of it because she found it vibrant and welcoming.\",\n    \"2:31 pm on 17 July, 2023: Caroline felt encouraged by the love and acceptance at the pride event; image: https://res.cloudinary.com/dragonspell/images/w_1440,h_864,c_fill,dpr_auto,fl_progressive:steep,f_auto/w_1440,h_864/v1571420662/www.travelportland.com/Portland-Pride-Parade-Downtown/Portland-Pride-Parade-Downtown.jpg; title: a photo of a woman holding a rainbow umbrella in the air\",\n    \"2:24 pm on 14 August, 2023: Caroline shared a photo of a group of people walking down a street with balloons at the pride parade; image: https://cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/opb/35SV3NIC4ZBRTLDGHUJ5QWU5WY.jpg; title: a photo of a group of people walking down a street with balloons\",\n    \"1:50 pm on 17 August, 2023: Caroline and Melanie (referred to as Mel) are planning a trip together for this summer to catch up and explore nature (originally stated as this summer relative to August 2023).

These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories from both speakers.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (原文指8月的一个月之前)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June/六月初”, “第一个周末”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (如逝者名单、车数、roadtrip 次数、共同点等).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories from both speakers. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7.

Example: “July (原文指8月的一个月之前)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June/六月初”, “第一个周末”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (如逝者名单、车数、roadtrip 次数、共同点等).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories from both speakers. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references unless instructed to keep them.\n\n    Memories for user Caroline:\n\n    [\n    \"1:36 pm on 3 July, 2023: Melanie made a bowl with a black and white flower design in a pottery class and feels proud of the work she put into it; image: https://therusticbarnct.com/cdn/shop/files/image_05483f46-4845-433b-a4cf-0fc61fe1aa79.jpg; title: a photo of a bowl with a black and white flower design\",\n    \"4:33 pm on 12 July, 2023: Melanie claims that her mental health is important to her.\",\n    \"1:14 pm on 25 May, 2023: Melanie's children are excited about their upcoming summer break.\",\n    \"7:55 pm on 9 June, 2023: Melanie has been married for 5 years.\",\n    \"1:51 pm on 15 July, 2023: Melanie recently moved (vague time expression: 'during your move').\",\n    \"1:33 pm on 25 August, 2023: Melanie claims pottery serves as a form of therapy for her, allowing her to express herself, be creative, find calm, and relax.
