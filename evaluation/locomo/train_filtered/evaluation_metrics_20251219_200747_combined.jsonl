{"data_source": "evaluation_metrics_20251219_200747_combined", "prompt": [{"content": "\n    You are an intelligent memory assistant tasked with retrieving accurate information from conversation memories.\n\n    # CONTEXT:\n    You have access to memories from two speakers in a conversation. These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references unless instructed to keep them.\n\n    Memories for user John:\n\n    [\n    \"1:24 pm on 25 May, 2023: John has been working on a petition he started and has been in touch with his workmates who went on a hiking trip together; image: https://pdx350.salsalabs.org/juneteamcampaignupdate/ca4594c6-1102-4939-b090-61f878580f48.jpg; title: a photo of a group of people and a dog standing in front of a waterfall\",\n    \"7:20 pm on 16 June, 2023: John is trying out different workout regimes and mentioned rock climbing as a fun way to push his limits\",\n    \"6:59 pm on 5 July, 2023: John said that his family, exercise, and spending time with friends keep him inspired\",\n    \"7:06 pm on 9 January, 2023: John has been busy with work and family since their last chat.\",\n    \"5:19 pm on 5 August, 2023: John has been looking into opportunities in the tech industry for a while\",\n    \"3:14 pm on 13 August, 2023: John said/claims that he and his family enjoy being outdoors by going for hikes, hanging out at the park, having picnics, playing board games, and having movie nights at home; image: https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0586/8149/1647/t/127/assets/pickneys_2-1662359454750.jpg; title: a photo of two children sitting at a table with a board game\",\n    \"12:24 am on 7 April, 2023: John started a weekend yoga class with a colleague (originally stated as 'started a weekend yoga class with a colleague' on 7 April, 2023).\",\n    \"6:03 pm on 6 March, 2023: John mentioned that he tries to find fun activities like walks, picnics in the park, and events in their town and beyond to make memories together; image: https://i.redd.it/eq0vvcinma621.jpg; title: a photo of a picture of a castle in a shadow box\",\n    \"8:55 pm on 25 February, 2023: John mentioned that his colleague Rob invited him to a beginner's yoga class.\",\n    \"6:10 pm on 22 December, 2022: John mentioned that he and his family enjoy climbing, sliding, and playing games at the playground, which is an awesome way to connect and have fun.\",\n    \"6:03 pm on 6 March, 2023: John said he tries to find things that his family will have fun with, such as walks, picnics in the park, or events in their town and beyond, and mentioned that last week he found a violin concert that they all enjoyed.

{"data_source": "evaluation_metrics_20251219_200747_combined", "prompt": [{"content": "\n    You are an intelligent memory assistant tasked with retrieving accurate information from conversation memories.\n\n    # CONTEXT:\n    You have access to memories from two speakers in a conversation. These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7.

{"data_source": "evaluation_metrics_20251219_200747_combined", "prompt": [{"content": "\n    You are an intelligent memory assistant tasked with retrieving accurate information from conversation memories.\n\n    # CONTEXT:\n    You have access to memories from two speakers in a conversation. These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references unless instructed to keep them.\n\n    Memories for user John:\n\n    [\n    \"12:10 am on 11 August, 2023: John said his best memory with Max was their camping trip last summer (originally stated as last summer relative to 2023-08-11, i.e., 2022-06-01 to 2022-08-31).

These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references unless instructed to keep them.\n\n    Memories for user John:\n\n    [\n    \"12:24 am on 7 April, 2023: Maria said/claims she did something new last weekend that had an impact on her; she participated in a 5K charity run for a homeless shelter.

These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7.

These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing.

If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6.

These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references unless instructed to keep them.\n\n    Memories for user John:\n\n    [\n    \"11:08 am on 16 August, 2023: John is excited about being involved and helping out his community (mentioned on 16 August, 2023 at 11:08 am).\",\n    \"11:08 am on 16 August, 2023: John is part of the fire-fighting brigade (mentioned on 16 August, 2023 at 11:08 am).\",\n    \"6:20 pm on 3 August, 2023: Last week (time relative to a specific day: '3 August, 2023'), John realized how much veterans have done for us and wanted to show his appreciation in some way\",\n    \"11:08 am on 16 August, 2023: John found being around the fire-fighting brigade inspiring (mentioned on 16 August, 2023 at 11:08 am).\",\n    \"7:38 pm on 20 May, 2023: John worked on a project to support veterans as his way of giving back\",\n    \"11:08 am on 16 August, 2023: Maria said she is here for John and mentioned that last Friday (time relative to a specific day: '11 August, 2023'), she spent some time at the shelter volunteering at the front desk\",\n    \"11:08 am on 16 August, 2023: Maria said John's involvement in the fire-fighting brigade is impressive (mentioned on 16 August, 2023 at 11:08 am).\",\n    \"11:08 am on 16 August, 2023: Maria noted that John is enthusiastic about making a change (mentioned on 16 August, 2023 at 11:08 am).\",\n    \"3:14 pm on 13 August, 2023: John is volunteering as a mentor for a local school (originally stated as 'since we last chatted' and 'it's really rewarding to see how much I can help these students')\",\n    \"7:20 pm on 16 June, 2023: John's promotion is a reward for his hustle and hardship, serving as a reminder that he is on the right path (originally stated as part of the conversation on 2023-06-16).\",\n    \"8:43 pm on 3 July, 2023: John participated in a marching event for veterans' rights on 3 July 2023 (originally stated as 'later today' relative to 2023-07-03, i.e., 2023-07-03) and found it awesome.\",\n    \"3:34 pm on 17 July, 2023: John claims that he is inspired by the community event he attended last month (originally stated as last month relative to 2023-07-17, i.e., June 2023) to try similar activities with his family and friends.\",\n    \"11:08 am on 16 August, 2023: John was impressed with the fire-fighting brigade's dedication and teamwork (mentioned on 16 August, 2023 at 11:08 am).\",\n    \"11:08 am on 16 August, 2023: John said it was awesome to see everyone working together (mentioned on 16 August, 2023 at 11:08 am).\",\n    \"7:34 pm on 18 April, 2023: Maria said that she is glad John has a good support system and that it has been great having people behind her while volunteering at the homeless shelter; positive influences make a big impact; giving talks at the homeless shelter was fulfilling and she received lots of compliments from other volunteers; giving talks at the homeless shelter was a great reminder about why connecting with and helping others is important.
