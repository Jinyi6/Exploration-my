These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories from both speakers\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps to determine the answer\n    3. If the question asks about a specific event or fact, look for direct evidence in the memories\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory\n    5. If there is a question about time references (like \"last year\", \"two months ago\", etc.), \n       calculate the actual date based on the memory timestamp. For example, if a memory from \n       4 May 2022 mentions \"went to India last year,\" then the trip occurred in 2021.\n    6. Always convert relative time references to specific dates, months, or years. For example, \n       convert \"last year\" to \"2022\" or \"two months ago\" to \"March 2023\" based on the memory \n       timestamp. Ignore the reference while answering the question.\n    7. Focus only on the content of the memories from both speakers. Do not confuse character \n       names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n    8. The answer should be less than 5-6 words.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question\n    4. If the answer requires calculation (e.g., converting relative time references), show your work\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked\n    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references\n\n    Memories for user John:\n\n    [\n    \"6:03 pm on 6 March, 2023: John finds activities that his family will enjoy, such as walks, picnics, or events in their town and beyond\",\n    \"6:10 pm on 22 December, 2022: John responded that he and his family love climbing, sliding, and playing games\",\n    \"6:10 pm on 22 December, 2022: John mentioned that they made pizza together, highlighting the fun of picking out toppings and sharing a tasty meal with family.\",\n    \"6:03 pm on 6 March, 2023: Last week, John found a violin concert that his family enjoyed\",\n    \"6:03 pm on 6 March, 2023: John and his family had a great time last weekend at the park, where the kids enjoyed the carefree joy\",\n    \"3:34 pm on 17 July, 2023: Maria praised John's idea of connecting with others and discovering fun activities, and noted it's cool how he adapted it for his family and friends\",\n    \"6:10 pm on 22 December, 2022: John asked Maria what she enjoys doing with her family\",\n    \"12:21 am on 27 June, 2023: John mentioned that last week, he and his family had a blast at a live music event, describing the energy in the air as amazing and the experience as awesome\",\n    \"3:14 pm on 13 August, 2023: John thanked Maria and mentioned that he loves being outdoors, going for hikes, hanging out at the park, having picnics, playing board games, and having movie nights at home.\",\n    \"3:34 pm on 17 July, 2023: John explained that the arts and crafts were part of a community event last month that had fun activities and games for families, and everyone was having a blast\",\n    \"6:03 pm on 6 March, 2023: John takes his kid to the park a few times a week for family bonding and letting the kids run around\",\n    \"6:03 pm on 6 March, 2023: John and his family had a picnic last week.\",\n    \"6:03 pm on 6 March, 2023: John's goal is to make memories together with his family\",\n    \"6:10 pm on 22 December, 2022: Maria commented on the playground photo and asked John what kind of stuff he and his family do there\",\n    \"7:20 pm on 16 June, 2023: John stated that enjoying special family times is why life is great\",\n    \"9:36 am on 2 April, 2023: John remembered volunteering together last year and said it was cool to see how their actions can make a big impact.
