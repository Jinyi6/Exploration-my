These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7.

{"data_source": "evaluation_metrics_20251220_083450_combined", "prompt": [{"content": "\n    You are an intelligent memory assistant tasked with retrieving accurate information from conversation memories.\n\n    # CONTEXT:\n    You have access to memories from two speakers in a conversation. These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references unless instructed to keep them.\n\n    Memories for user Tim:\n\n    [\n    \"10:04 am on 19 December, 2023: John said their team has seen the most growth in communication and bonding\",\n    \"10:04 am on 19 December, 2023: John said the growth in communication and bonding has really helped their performances by allowing them to understand each other's strengths and weaknesses\",\n    \"7:48 pm on 21 May, 2023: John said that things are going well with the new team and that the team has been really nice and he's having fun.\",\n    \"3:37 pm on 16 December, 2023: John said these experiences make him love the game.\",\n    \"5:24 pm on 7 January, 2024: John said that the benefit basketball game turned out to be a total success\",\n    \"10:04 am on 19 December, 2023: Tim said 'Take care and talk soon!' as a closing statement; Tim asked John about the areas where they saw the most growth during their training; John said their team has seen the most growth in communication and bonding; John said the growth in communication and bonding has really helped their performances by allowing them to understand each other's strengths and weaknesses; Tim said 'Wow, that's awesome!

These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references unless instructed to keep them.\n\n    Memories for user Tim:\n\n    [\n    \"10:22 am on 21 November, 2023: Tim mentioned that he has been swamped with studies and projects, but last week (time relative to a specific day: '21 November, 2023') he had a setback with writing a story based on his experiences in the UK, which didn't go as planned.

{"data_source": "evaluation_metrics_20251220_083450_combined", "prompt": [{"content": "\n    You are an intelligent memory assistant tasked with retrieving accurate information from conversation memories.\n\n    # CONTEXT:\n    You have access to memories from two speakers in a conversation. These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references unless instructed to keep them.\n\n    Memories for user Tim:\n\n    [\n    \"5:34 pm on 6 December, 2023: Tim said he joined a travel club, is working on studies, picked up new skills, and recently started learning an instrument (as of 5:34 pm on 6 December, 2023).\",\n    \"4:17 pm on 2 August, 2023: Tim is writing about different fantasy novels, studying characters, themes, and making book recommendations (vague time expression: 'recently')\",\n    \"3:35 pm on 26 December, 2023: Tim has been reading cool stories from travelers from around the world to plan his next adventure (originally stated on 2023-12-26 at 3:35 pm)\",\n    \"6:59 pm on 26 August, 2023: Tim said that he is adding NYC to his travel list and that it sounds like a great adventure\",\n    \"1:41 pm on 12 January, 2024: Tim shared that he is trying to understand visa requirements for some places he wants to visit, finding it overwhelming but exciting.\",\n    \"5:34 pm on 6 December, 2023: Tim mentioned joining a travel club (originally stated as 'a few days ago' relative to 2023-12-06, i.e., around 2023-11-30) and expressed interest in different cultures and countries, excitement about meeting new people, and learning about what makes them unique; image: https://i.redd.it/w404u5zhn0yz.jpg; title: a photo of a map of westendell on a wall\",\n    \"5:24 pm on 7 January, 2024: John congratulated Tim on being accepted into the study abroad program.\",\n    \"5:26 pm on 2 January, 2024: Tim is learning German, which he finds tough but fun.

{"data_source": "evaluation_metrics_20251220_083450_combined", "prompt": [{"content": "\n    You are an intelligent memory assistant tasked with retrieving accurate information from conversation memories.\n\n    # CONTEXT:\n    You have access to memories from two speakers in a conversation. These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references unless instructed to keep them.\n\n    Memories for user Tim:\n\n    [\n    \"5:26 pm on 2 January, 2024: John said/claims that they have watched a bunch of the Lord of the Rings movies and that they are inspiring, and that their favorite character is Aragorn because he grows so much throughout the story\",\n    \"5:26 pm on 2 January, 2024: John said he has watched a bunch of movies and they are inspiring; his favorite character is Aragorn because he grows so much throughout the story.\",\n    \"5:26 pm on 2 January, 2024: John said Aragorn is a great leader and puts others first, which is why he eventually becomes king.\",\n    \"5:26 pm on 2 January, 2024: Tim asked John why Aragorn is his favorite.\",\n    \"5:26 pm on 2 January, 2024: Tim said that is awesome and asked John what is it about Aragorn that makes him so inspiring.\",\n    \"5:26 pm on 2 January, 2024: John said Aragorn's brave, selfless, down-to-earth attitude is what inspired him.
