These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories from both speakers.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (原文指8月的一个月之前)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June/六月初”, “第一个周末”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (如逝者名单、车数、roadtrip 次数、共同点等).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories from both speakers. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7.

These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories from both speakers.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (原文指8月的一个月之前)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June/六月初”, “第一个周末”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (如逝者名单、车数、roadtrip 次数、共同点等).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories from both speakers.

These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories from both speakers.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (原文指8月的一个月之前)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June/六月初”, “第一个周末”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4.

For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (如逝者名单、车数、roadtrip 次数、共同点等).\n    6.

These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories from both speakers.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (原文指8月的一个月之前)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June/六月初”, “第一个周末”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (如逝者名单、车数、roadtrip 次数、共同点等).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories from both speakers. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7.

{"data_source": "evaluation_metrics_20251203_030123_combined", "prompt": [{"content": "\n    You are an intelligent memory assistant tasked with retrieving accurate information from conversation memories.\n\n    # CONTEXT:\n    You have access to memories from two speakers in a conversation. These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories from both speakers.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (原文指8月的一个月之前)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June/六月初”, “第一个周末”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (如逝者名单、车数、roadtrip 次数、共同点等).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories from both speakers. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references unless instructed to keep them.\n\n    Memories for user John:\n\n    [\n    \"3:34 pm on 17 July, 2023: John attended a community event with arts and crafts and fun activities for families in June 2023 (originally stated as last month relative to July 17, 2023, i.e., June 2023).\",\n    \"3:18 pm on 4 May, 2023: John's kids are getting excited about staying active.\",\n    \"2:47 pm on 12 June, 2023: John has gone camping plenty of times.\",\n    \"6:20 pm on 3 August, 2023: John believes it is amazing what teamwork can accomplish.\",\n    \"12:21 am on 27 June, 2023: John attended a live music event (specifically a violin concert) with his family last week, where they danced and enjoyed the amazing energy (time relative to a specific day: 'last week').\",\n    \"7:34 pm on 18 April, 2023: John and his colleagues went to a convention together in March 2023 (originally stated as last month relative to April 2023).\",\n    \"6:59 pm on 5 July, 2023: John took a trip with his family for his daughter Sara's birthday in 2022 (originally stated as last year relative to July 5, 2023, i.e., 2022).\",\n    \"1:59 pm on 31 July, 2023: John had his first call-out on July 23, 2023, where his team saved a family from a burning building (originally stated as Last Sunday relative to July 31, 2023, i.e., July 23, 2023).\",\n    \"3:18 pm on 4 May, 2023: John started going to boot camps with his family last month for bonding and getting fit (originally stated as last month relative to May 2023, i.e., April 2023).\",\n    \"3:14 pm on 13 August, 2023: John is off to spend time with his family on August 13, 2023 (originally stated as now relative to August 13, 2023).\",\n    \"12:10 am on 11 August, 2023: John went on a camping trip with Max last summer (originally stated as last summer relative to August 11 2023, i.e., Summer 2022) where they hiked, swam, and had a peaceful and awesome experience that felt like a restart for John's mind and spirit.\",\n    \"6:13 pm on 10 April, 2023: John returned from a family road trip to the Pacific Northwest coast and national parks on December 16, 2022 (originally stated as yesterday relative to December 17, 2022).\",\n    \"3:34 pm on 17 July, 2023: John plans to try out the activities and games from the community event with his family and friends.\",\n    \"8:06 pm on 9 August, 2023: John participated in a community event last weekend to raise money for a good cause, noting a great turnout and supportive people (time relative to a specific day: 'last weekend'); image: https://www.rockawave.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/1-Family-Run-Remembers-Eileen-Lavin.jpg; title: a photo of a young girl holding a sign in her hands\",\n    \"8:43 pm on 3 July, 2023: John participated in a marching event for veterans' rights recently, which he found awesome and reminded him of their sacrifice (vague time expression: 'just').\",\n    \"3:18 pm on 4 May, 2023: John and his family find pushing themselves and supporting each other during boot camp workouts to be super motivating, specifically by cheering each other on and providing emotional support.\",\n    \"6:10 pm on 22 December, 2022: John plans to do taekwondo (originally stated on December 22, 2022).\",\n    \"6:13 pm on 10 April, 2023: John's car broke down on his way to work on April 7, 2023 (originally stated as last Fri relative to April 10, 2023).\",\n    \"3:18 pm on 4 May, 2023: John made an apple pie for the kids on May 3, 2023 (originally stated as yesterday relative to May 4, 2023); image: 'https://i.redd.it/tc1f75pa9df21.jpg'; title: a photo of a person holding a plate with a banana split ice cream sundae.\",\n    \"8:30 pm on 1 January, 2023: John and his group organized a toy drive for kids in need, finding it amazing to see the community come together to spread joy.\",\n    \"6:10 pm on 22 December, 2022: John and his family made pizza together, enjoying the process of picking out toppings and sharing the meal.\",\n    \"7:38 pm on 20 May, 2023: John threw a small party inviting veterans to share stories, observing that they made connections and found camaraderie.

These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories from both speakers.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (原文指8月的一个月之前)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June/六月初”, “第一个周末”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (如逝者名单、车数、roadtrip 次数、共同点等).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories from both speakers. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7.
