{"data_source": "evaluation_metrics_20251220_214552_combined", "prompt": [{"content": "\n    You are an intelligent memory assistant tasked with retrieving accurate information from conversation memories.\n\n    # CONTEXT:\n    You have access to memories from two speakers in a conversation. These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references unless instructed to keep them.\n\n    Memories for user Joanna:\n\n    [\n    \"7:31 pm on 21 January, 2022: Joanna's favorite movie genres are dramas and romcoms, as she enjoys getting immersed in the feelings and plots.\",\n    \"8:10 pm on 7 November, 2022: Joanna suggests making great memories and supporting each other while reaching for their dreams.\",\n    \"11:54 am on 2 May, 2022: Joanna enjoys experimenting in the kitchen and creating tasty dairy-free snacks.\",\n    \"6:03 pm on 5 September, 2022: Joanna is finding comfort and creativity by tweaking dessert recipes to make them yummier and more accessible.\",\n    \"2:01 pm on 23 January, 2022: Joanna finds joy in writing and hanging with friends.\",\n    \"7:49 pm on 20 May, 2022: Joanna's work is personal and focuses on loss, identity, and connection.\",\n    \"10:58 am on 9 October, 2022: Joanna recommends watching movies on a nice comfy couch with a good blanket for a peaceful experience.\",\n    \"11:54 am on 2 May, 2022: Joanna views cooking and baking as her creative outlets.\",\n    \"7:49 pm on 20 May, 2022: Joanna mentions being able to talk about her work and receive feedback from friends, which she finds priceless.\",\n    \"2:01 pm on 23 January, 2022: Joanna is committed to pursuing her passion for writing.\",\n    \"10:58 am on 9 October, 2022: Joanna mentions she gets invested in random little things that make life nicer.\",\n    \"11:54 am on 2 May, 2022: Joanna is talented at making dairy-free desserts.\",\n    \"10:58 am on 9 October, 2022: Joanna said that meeting people who share interests definitely makes experiences more fun.\",\n    \"2:12 pm on 5 June, 2022: Joanna has a cork board in her room filled with inspiring quotes, pictures, and little keepsakes for motivation and creativity.\",\n    \"7:49 pm on 20 May, 2022: Joanna has friends who understand and appreciate her work, which she finds priceless for discussing and receiving feedback.\",\n    \"10:58 am on 9 October, 2022: Joanna suggests getting a couch that can sit multiple people and is fluffy, a weighted blanket, and dimmable lights.\",\n    \"7:49 pm on 20 May, 2022: Joanna says writing and creative projects get her through tough times.\",\n    \"11:54 am on 2 May, 2022: Joanna gets satisfaction from seeing people enjoy her creations.\",\n    \"2:01 pm on 23 January, 2022: Nate encouraged Joanna to keep doing what she loves.\",\n    \"3:56 pm on 4 November, 2022: Joanna was inspired by stories about finding courage and taking risks even back when she was 10.\",\n    \"6:12 pm on 14 August, 2022: Joanna has been busy with writing projects and considers writing a huge part of her life; it has been a mix of highs and lows, and her journal is her rock. ; image: https://i.pinimg.com/originals/2f/df/23/2fdf2357bee9649780477b595cb2b003.jpg; title: a photo of a notebook with a bunch of stickers on it\",\n    \"11:54 am on 2 May, 2022: Joanna plans to keep trying new things in her cooking and baking.\",\n    \"8:10 pm on 7 November, 2022: Joanna encourages looking back on fond memories as a blessing.\",\n    \"10:55 am on 24 June, 2022: Joanna said her family loves it when she makes them new things.\",\n    \"7:31 pm on 21 January, 2022: Joanna and Nate have similar interests.\",\n    \"11:15 am on 6 October, 2022: Joanna is glad Nate enjoyed 'Little Women' and mentions she recommended it to him earlier.

{"data_source": "evaluation_metrics_20251220_214552_combined", "prompt": [{"content": "\n    You are an intelligent memory assistant tasked with retrieving accurate information from conversation memories.\n\n    # CONTEXT:\n    You have access to memories from two speakers in a conversation. These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references unless instructed to keep them.\n\n    Memories for user Joanna:\n\n    [\n    \"7:31 pm on 21 January, 2022: Joanna and Nate have similar interests.\",\n    \"7:31 pm on 21 January, 2022: Nate expressed interest in checking out a romantic drama that Joanna recommended.\",\n    \"7:44 pm on 21 April, 2022: Nate said he is glad to see an interest and encouraged Joanna to let him know her thoughts.\",\n    \"3:56 pm on 4 November, 2022: Nate expressed interest in trying Joanna's chocolate and raspberry cake.\",\n    \"8:16 pm on 25 October, 2022: Joanna agreed with Nate's idea and expressed that she is already invested in the turtles.

{"data_source": "evaluation_metrics_20251220_214552_combined", "prompt": [{"content": "\n    You are an intelligent memory assistant tasked with retrieving accurate information from conversation memories.\n\n    # CONTEXT:\n    You have access to memories from two speakers in a conversation. These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references unless instructed to keep them.\n\n    Memories for user Joanna:\n\n    [\n    \"7:31 pm on 21 January, 2022: Joanna first watched the romantic drama around 3 years ago (relative to 2022-01-21, i.e., 2019-01-21).\",\n    \"7:31 pm on 21 January, 2022: Joanna went out and got a physical copy of the movie she first watched 3 years ago.\",\n    \"8:16 pm on 25 October, 2022: Joanna contributed to a movie script that was shown on the big screen for the first time last Sunday (2022-10-23).\",\n    \"2:01 pm on 21 October, 2022: Joanna said: 'Thanks!

These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4.

{"data_source": "evaluation_metrics_20251220_214552_combined", "prompt": [{"content": "\n    You are an intelligent memory assistant tasked with retrieving accurate information from conversation memories.\n\n    # CONTEXT:\n    You have access to memories from two speakers in a conversation. These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references unless instructed to keep them.\n\n    Memories for user Joanna:\n\n    [\n    \"12:06 am on 11 November, 2022: Nate took his turtles to the beach in Tampa yesterday (originally stated as yesterday relative to 2022-11-11, i.e., 2022-11-10).\",\n    \"5:54 pm on 9 November, 2022: Nate explained that he saw another turtle at a pet store and had to get him because the tank is now big enough for three.\",\n    \"5:54 pm on 9 November, 2022: Joanna asked Nate what made him get a third turtle.\",\n    \"5:54 pm on 9 November, 2022: Nate has had turtles for 3 years and they bring him tons of joy.

These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references unless instructed to keep them.\n\n    Memories for user Joanna:\n\n    [\n    \"8:16 pm on 25 October, 2022: Joanna contributed to a movie script that was shown on the big screen for the first time last Sunday (2022-10-23).\",\n    \"11:15 am on 6 October, 2022: Joanna finished her writing for her book last week (time relative to a specific day: '6 October, 2022'), which involved late nights and edits, and she is proud of her accomplishment.\",\n    \"10:55 am on 24 June, 2022: Nate said that Joanna's screenplay submission is cool and that he hopes it does well (on 24 June, 2022).\",\n    \"7:31 pm on 21 January, 2022: Joanna first watched the romantic drama around 3 years ago (relative to 2022-01-21, i.e., 2019-01-21).\",\n    \"1:07 pm on 25 February, 2022: Joanna is working on a new screenplay while waiting to hear about the success of her first one.\",\n    \"5:44 pm on 3 June, 2022: Joanna received a rejection letter from a major company after finishing her screenplay.\",\n    \"3:00 pm on 25 May, 2022: Joanna said thinking back to the tough times finishing her screenplay made her realize that moments bringing joy make the journey worth it.\",\n    \"3:00 pm on 25 May, 2022: Joanna reflects on the tough times finishing her screenplay, realizing that those moments bring joy and make the journey worth it.\",\n    \"1:07 pm on 25 February, 2022: Joanna's new screenplay is about a thirty-year-old woman on a journey of self-discovery after a loss.\",\n    \"1:07 pm on 25 February, 2022: Joanna wished for good luck regarding her screenplay.\",\n    \"9:27 am on 7 February, 2022: Joanna feels a mix of relief, excitement, and worry about the screenplay's reception.

These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references unless instructed to keep them.\n\n    Memories for user Joanna:\n\n    [\n    \"9:27 am on 7 February, 2022: Joanna feels a mix of relief, excitement, and worry about the screenplay's reception.

{"data_source": "evaluation_metrics_20251220_214552_combined", "prompt": [{"content": "\n    You are an intelligent memory assistant tasked with retrieving accurate information from conversation memories.\n\n    # CONTEXT:\n    You have access to memories from two speakers in a conversation. These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references unless instructed to keep them.\n\n    Memories for user Joanna:\n\n    [\n    \"5:44 pm on 3 June, 2022: Nate mentioned he won his first video game tournament last week (time relative to a specific day: 'last week').\",\n    \"11:15 am on 6 October, 2022: Nate won a really big video game tournament last week (time relative to a specific day: '2022-10-06') and it was awesome; image: https://i.redd.it/0z7nrwjeqc431.jpg; title: a photo of a trophy and a game controller on a table\",\n    \"10:55 am on 24 June, 2022: Nate responded to Joanna's message, acknowledging that submitting a screenplay to a film festival is a big deal.

These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4.

{"data_source": "evaluation_metrics_20251220_214552_combined", "prompt": [{"content": "\n    You are an intelligent memory assistant tasked with retrieving accurate information from conversation memories.\n\n    # CONTEXT:\n    You have access to memories from two speakers in a conversation. These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references unless instructed to keep them.\n\n    Memories for user Joanna:\n\n    [\n    \"5:44 pm on 3 June, 2022: Joanna received a rejection letter from a major company after finishing her screenplay.\",\n    \"2:01 pm on 21 October, 2022: Joanna had a setback recently - another rejection from a production company (vague time expression: 'recently').\",\n    \"5:44 pm on 3 June, 2022: Joanna explained that the company sent her a generic rejection letter without much feedback.\",\n    \"5:44 pm on 3 June, 2022: Joanna was bummed out by the rejection letter.\",\n    \"5:44 pm on 3 June, 2022: Joanna found it disheartening not knowing why her screenplay didn't work out.\",\n    \"1:07 pm on 25 February, 2022: Joanna wished for good luck regarding her screenplay.\",\n    \"9:27 am on 7 February, 2022: Joanna sent a screenplay to a film festival and has been thinking about it all day every day.\",\n    \"10:55 am on 24 June, 2022: Nate said that Joanna's screenplay submission is cool and that he hopes it does well (on 24 June, 2022).\",\n    \"1:07 pm on 25 February, 2022: Joanna's new screenplay is about a thirty-year-old woman on a journey of self-discovery after a loss.\",\n    \"9:27 am on 7 February, 2022: Nate responded to Joanna's message, acknowledging that submitting a screenplay to a film festival is a big deal.\",\n    \"5:44 pm on 3 June, 2022: Joanna mentioned that rejection can feel like a step back sometimes.\",\n    \"1:07 pm on 25 February, 2022: Joanna expressed hope that her screenplay finds a fan and is given its due.\",\n    \"1:07 pm on 25 February, 2022: Joanna finds inspiration in writing screenplays similar to her previous one.\",\n    \"8:16 pm on 25 October, 2022: Joanna contributed to a movie script that was shown on the big screen for the first time last Sunday (2022-10-23).\",\n    \"1:07 pm on 25 February, 2022: Joanna is working on a new screenplay while waiting to hear about the success of her first one.\",\n    \"1:07 pm on 25 February, 2022: Joanna is hoping her screenplay gets noticed and makes it to the screen.\",\n    \"1:07 pm on 25 February, 2022: Nate also wished Joanna good luck for her screenplay.\",\n    \"3:00 pm on 25 May, 2022: Nate responds by saying he can't wait to see Joanna's screenplay and offers his support.\",\n    \"3:00 pm on 25 May, 2022: Joanna expresses excitement about showing her screenplay to Nate and values his opinion.\",\n    \"9:27 am on 7 February, 2022: Joanna feels a mix of relief, excitement, and worry about the screenplay's reception.

{"data_source": "evaluation_metrics_20251220_214552_combined", "prompt": [{"content": "\n    You are an intelligent memory assistant tasked with retrieving accurate information from conversation memories.\n\n    # CONTEXT:\n    You have access to memories from two speakers in a conversation. These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references unless instructed to keep them.\n\n    Memories for user Joanna:\n\n    [\n    \"11:15 am on 6 October, 2022: Nate won a really big video game tournament last week (time relative to a specific day: '2022-10-06') and it was awesome; image: https://i.redd.it/0z7nrwjeqc431.jpg; title: a photo of a trophy and a game controller on a table\",\n    \"5:44 pm on 3 June, 2022: Nate mentioned he won his first video game tournament last week (time relative to a specific day: 'last week').\",\n    \"3:56 pm on 4 November, 2022: Nate helped some friends reset their high scores at the international tournament (event occurred on 4 November, 2022).\",\n    \"10:58 am on 9 October, 2022: Nate started hanging out with some people outside of his circle at the tournament.

Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references unless instructed to keep them.\n\n    Memories for user Joanna:\n\n    [\n    \"3:56 pm on 4 November, 2022: Nate invited Joanna to come over and try some ice cream that he made (event occurred on 4 November, 2022).\",\n    \"6:44 pm on 17 April, 2022: Joanna expresses her love for Nate's ice cream and mentions she wishes she could make it the way he does.

{"data_source": "evaluation_metrics_20251220_214552_combined", "prompt": [{"content": "\n    You are an intelligent memory assistant tasked with retrieving accurate information from conversation memories.\n\n    # CONTEXT:\n    You have access to memories from two speakers in a conversation. These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references unless instructed to keep them.\n\n    Memories for user Joanna:\n\n    [\n    \"1:43 pm on 14 September, 2022: Nate taught vegan ice cream recipes on his cooking show last Monday (time relative to a specific day: 'last Monday relative to 2022-09-14').\",\n    \"1:43 pm on 14 September, 2022: Nate found the experience of teaching on his cooking show nerve-wracking but also a blast, and he picked up a few new recipes.\",\n    \"3:56 pm on 4 November, 2022: Nate invited Joanna to come over and try some ice cream that he made (event occurred on 4 November, 2022).\",\n    \"10:55 am on 24 June, 2022: Nate mentioned that he has been doing great (on 24 June, 2022).\",\n    \"6:03 pm on 5 September, 2022: Nate believes baking and cooking brings people together.\",\n    \"3:56 pm on 4 November, 2022: Nate found it fun to help with the high scores (event occurred on 4 November, 2022).\",\n    \"3:56 pm on 4 November, 2022: Joanna agreed that Nate's actions were passionate and felt good to make a difference (event occurred on 4 November, 2022).\",\n    \"6:44 pm on 17 April, 2022: Nate mentions that he loves watching the turtles play and enjoys the peaceful moments of life, sometimes even bringing them into the kitchen to watch him make food.

These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references unless instructed to keep them.\n\n    Memories for user Joanna:\n\n    [\n    \"1:43 pm on 14 September, 2022: Joanna mentioned that her laptop crashed last week (time relative to a specific day: 'last week relative to 2022-09-14') and she lost all her work, which was very frustrating for her as a writer.\",\n    \"1:43 pm on 14 September, 2022: Joanna said that nothing was recoverable from the laptop crash but now she has an external drive for backups.\",\n    \"3:35 pm on 12 May, 2022: Joanna confirmed the plan and said she would see Nate later (3:35 pm on 12 May, 2022).\",\n    \"3:56 pm on 4 November, 2022: Joanna agreed that Nate's actions were passionate and felt good to make a difference (event occurred on 4 November, 2022).\",\n    \"3:35 pm on 12 May, 2022: Nate responded with a farewell to Joanna (3:35 pm on 12 May, 2022).\",\n    \"10:55 am on 24 June, 2022: Joanna agreed with Nate, saying that it doesn't matter if they use the controller accessories, it's the thought that matters (on 24 June, 2022).\",\n    \"2:01 pm on 21 October, 2022: Joanna said: 'Thanks!

These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references unless instructed to keep them.\n\n    Memories for user Joanna:\n\n    [\n    \"11:15 am on 6 October, 2022: Nate won a really big video game tournament last week (time relative to a specific day: '2022-10-06') and it was awesome; image: https://i.redd.it/0z7nrwjeqc431.jpg; title: a photo of a trophy and a game controller on a table\",\n    \"5:44 pm on 3 June, 2022: Nate mentioned he won his first video game tournament last week (time relative to a specific day: 'last week').\",\n    \"10:55 am on 24 June, 2022: Nate responded to Joanna's message, acknowledging that submitting a screenplay to a film festival is a big deal.

{"data_source": "evaluation_metrics_20251220_214552_combined", "prompt": [{"content": "\n    You are an intelligent memory assistant tasked with retrieving accurate information from conversation memories.\n\n    # CONTEXT:\n    You have access to memories from two speakers in a conversation. These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references unless instructed to keep them.\n\n    Memories for user Joanna:\n\n    [\n    \"10:58 am on 9 October, 2022: Nate played a game called Catan at the convention, which is a strategy game where you build settlements and trade resources.

Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references unless instructed to keep them.\n\n    Memories for user Joanna:\n\n    [\n    \"8:16 pm on 25 October, 2022: Joanna mentioned that this was the third time her script was shown on the big screen, and she found it awesome.\",\n    \"8:16 pm on 25 October, 2022: Joanna contributed to a movie script that was shown on the big screen for the first time last Sunday (2022-10-23).\",\n    \"1:07 pm on 25 February, 2022: Joanna is hoping her screenplay gets noticed and makes it to the screen.\",\n    \"1:07 pm on 25 February, 2022: Joanna finds inspiration in writing screenplays similar to her previous one.\",\n    \"9:27 am on 7 February, 2022: Joanna sent a screenplay to a film festival and has been thinking about it all day every day.\",\n    \"1:43 pm on 24 March, 2022: Joanna had an audition yesterday (originally stated as yesterday relative to 2022-03-24, i.e., 2022-03-23) for a writing gig.\",\n    \"10:58 am on 9 October, 2022: Joanna would rate the movie she watched as 9 or 10 out of 10.\",\n    \"2:01 pm on 23 January, 2022: Writing allows Joanna to express herself through stories and create wild worlds with awesome characters.\",\n    \"1:07 pm on 25 February, 2022: Joanna's new screenplay is about a thirty-year-old woman on a journey of self-discovery after a loss.\",\n    \"6:12 pm on 14 August, 2022: Joanna has been busy with writing projects and considers writing a huge part of her life; it has been a mix of highs and lows, and her journal is her rock. ; image: https://i.pinimg.com/originals/2f/df/23/2fdf2357bee9649780477b595cb2b003.jpg; title: a photo of a notebook with a bunch of stickers on it\",\n    \"2:01 pm on 23 January, 2022: Joanna is committed to pursuing her passion for writing.\",\n    \"11:15 am on 6 October, 2022: Joanna finished her writing for her book last week (time relative to a specific day: '6 October, 2022'), which involved late nights and edits, and she is proud of her accomplishment.\",\n    \"3:56 pm on 4 November, 2022: Joanna has a favorite piece from her early writings, a story about a brave little turtle who was scared but explored the world anyway (when she was 10).\",\n    \"7:49 pm on 20 May, 2022: Joanna found that she writes best when being true to herself, even if it's hard.\",\n    \"2:01 pm on 23 January, 2022: Joanna considers writing a great way to express her feelings and cannot imagine life without it.\",\n    \"2:01 pm on 23 January, 2022: Joanna finds joy in writing and hanging with friends.\",\n    \"3:56 pm on 4 November, 2022: The story about the brave little turtle is still a part of Joanna's writing today.\",\n    \"6:12 pm on 14 August, 2022: Joanna confirmed that writing has become an escape and a way to express her feelings.

{"data_source": "evaluation_metrics_20251220_214552_combined", "prompt": [{"content": "\n    You are an intelligent memory assistant tasked with retrieving accurate information from conversation memories.\n\n    # CONTEXT:\n    You have access to memories from two speakers in a conversation. These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references unless instructed to keep them.\n\n    Memories for user Joanna:\n\n    [\n    \"12:06 am on 11 November, 2022: Nate took his turtles to the beach in Tampa yesterday (originally stated as yesterday relative to 2022-11-11, i.e., 2022-11-10).\",\n    \"5:54 pm on 9 November, 2022: Nate has had turtles for 3 years and they bring him tons of joy.

These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references unless instructed to keep them.\n\n    Memories for user Joanna:\n\n    [\n    \"7:37 pm on 15 April, 2022: Joanna was inspired by a sunset she saw while hiking the other day (time relative to a specific day: 'the other day')\",\n    \"3:56 pm on 4 November, 2022: Joanna was inspired by stories about finding courage and taking risks even back when she was 10.\",\n    \"3:35 pm on 12 May, 2022: Joanna stated that nature inspires her and that hiking has opened up a whole new world for her, making her feel like a different person now\",\n    \"1:07 pm on 25 February, 2022: Joanna finds inspiration in writing screenplays similar to her previous one.\",\n    \"6:12 pm on 14 August, 2022: Nate said that it's amazing how much an activity can become a part of someone's life and that Joanna is inspiring.

These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references unless instructed to keep them.\n\n    Memories for user Joanna:\n\n    [\n    \"8:10 pm on 7 November, 2022: Joanna encourages looking back on fond memories as a blessing.\",\n    \"8:10 pm on 7 November, 2022: Joanna suggests making great memories and supporting each other while reaching for their dreams.\",\n    \"3:00 pm on 25 May, 2022: Joanna emphasizes that appreciating the journey and being aware of happy moments can be a game-changer, helping to keep people focused on their dreams.\",\n    \"10:58 am on 9 October, 2022: Nate encouraged Joanna to keep doing what makes him happy, emphasizing the importance of staying happy and de-stressing.\",\n    \"3:00 pm on 25 May, 2022: Joanna said she appreciates small joys like the cute stuffed animal, which serves as a nice reminder.\",\n    \"2:01 pm on 23 January, 2022: Joanna said she finds other ways to be happy despite her allergies.\",\n    \"8:10 pm on 7 November, 2022: Nate agrees to start writing down some of his favorite memories with Joanna from now on.\",\n    \"2:01 pm on 21 October, 2022: Nate praised Joanna for her resilience and ability to bounce back from sad events.\",\n    \"2:01 pm on 21 October, 2022: The name Tilly helps Joanna remember her previous dog and the time she could hold and squeeze animals without an allergic reaction.\",\n    \"2:01 pm on 23 January, 2022: Joanna finds joy in writing and hanging with friends.\",\n    \"6:44 pm on 17 April, 2022: Joanna agreed with Nate, saying that even small things make life enjoyable and worth it, and that taking time for little friends and doing loved activities are treasures that remind us of life's greatness and peace, emphasizing the need to savor them (17 April 2022, 6:44 pm).\",\n    \"9:27 am on 7 February, 2022: Joanna complimented Nate's ice cream and expressed happiness that he tried something new.\",\n    \"6:12 pm on 14 August, 2022: Nate said he likes that Joanna uses writing as an escape and that it's incredible how words can turn something sad into something special.

{"data_source": "evaluation_metrics_20251220_214552_combined", "prompt": [{"content": "\n    You are an intelligent memory assistant tasked with retrieving accurate information from conversation memories.\n\n    # CONTEXT:\n    You have access to memories from two speakers in a conversation. These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references unless instructed to keep them.\n\n    Memories for user Joanna:\n\n    [\n    \"3:35 pm on 12 May, 2022: Joanna mentioned that she went hiking and found some more amazing trails in her town on 12 May, 2022 (vague time expression: 'quite a week since we last talked')\",\n    \"6:44 pm on 17 April, 2022: Joanna found an awesome hiking trail in her hometown yesterday (originally stated as yesterday relative to 2022-04-17, i.e., 2022-04-16)\",\n    \"5:44 pm on 3 June, 2022: Nate told Joanna to have a great hike and take lots of pictures, and said goodbye.\",\n    \"3:35 pm on 12 May, 2022: Joanna described the hiking experience as awesome and believes she is now an expert hiker\",\n    \"3:35 pm on 12 May, 2022: Joanna stated that nature inspires her and that hiking has opened up a whole new world for her, making her feel like a different person now\",\n    \"5:44 pm on 3 June, 2022: Joanna said she has plans to hike with some buddies this weekend.\",\n    \"3:35 pm on 12 May, 2022: Nate expressed a wish to have been at Whispering Falls and commented that Joanna's hikes sound like a blast\",\n    \"5:54 pm on 9 November, 2022: Joanna said it's great to support each other in reaching goals and shared a sunset photo she took on a hike last summer near Fort Wayne; image: https://i.redd.it/ap48tronzy41.jpg; title: a photo of a sunflower in a field with a sunset in the background\",\n    \"6:44 pm on 17 April, 2022: Joanna described the hiking trail as gorgeous and noted that nature is inspiring and a great way to reset\",\n    \"6:44 pm on 17 April, 2022: Joanna suggested that she might have to convince Nate to go hiking with her one of these times\",\n    \"3:35 pm on 12 May, 2022: Nate asked Joanna if she took any photos of the hiking experience\",\n    \"6:44 pm on 17 April, 2022: Joanna asked Nate if he knows of any good hiking spots\",\n    \"7:37 pm on 15 April, 2022: Joanna was inspired by a sunset she saw while hiking the other day (time relative to a specific day: 'the other day')\",\n    \"3:35 pm on 12 May, 2022: Joanna confirmed she took photos and mentioned loving a specific spot on the hike with a soothing rush of water; image: https://burst.shopifycdn.com/photos/large-rolling-waterfall-though-a-lush-green-hill.jpg; title: a photo of a waterfall with a dark sky in the background\",\n    \"5:44 pm on 3 June, 2022: Joanna mentioned they are checking out a new trail with a rad waterfall.\",\n    \"3:35 pm on 12 May, 2022: Joanna laughed at Nate's suggestion and agreed to invite him to join her on the trails.\",\n    \"3:35 pm on 12 May, 2022: Joanna said she often reflects on her life when out and about, but the trails had a special effect that made her feel like writing a drama.\",\n    \"7:44 pm on 21 April, 2022: Joanna said she has heard of the series and that it's been on her list forever, thanking Nate for the recommendation.\",\n    \"7:31 pm on 21 January, 2022: Joanna has been working on a project that she described as 'pretty cool'.\",\n    \"10:58 am on 9 October, 2022: Joanna would rate the movie she watched as 9 or 10 out of 10.\",\n    \"6:44 pm on 17 April, 2022: Joanna mentioned that she has been reading a lot in the past week (time relative to a specific day: 'past week')\",\n    \"1:43 pm on 24 March, 2022: Joanna wished Nate luck in the tournament and noted that it would be difficult to go through so many days of intense gaming.\",\n    \"7:49 pm on 20 May, 2022: Joanna thanked Nate for his support, stating that having people like him cheering her on makes her journey easier.\",\n    \"3:56 pm on 4 November, 2022: Joanna mentioned she has been working on a challenging but fulfilling project, in addition to meetings.\",\n    \"8:16 pm on 25 October, 2022: Joanna found the idea of taking turtles for a walk fun and asked if they had a good time.\",\n    \"7:49 pm on 20 May, 2022: Joanna responded to Nate's greeting and mentioned that she just finished something, describing it as a pretty wild journey.\",\n    \"5:44 pm on 3 June, 2022: Joanna said, 'Yeah, you're right.

Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references unless instructed to keep them.\n\n    Memories for user Joanna:\n\n    [\n    \"6:44 pm on 17 April, 2022: Nate mentions that he loves watching the turtles play and enjoys the peaceful moments of life, sometimes even bringing them into the kitchen to watch him make food.

{"data_source": "evaluation_metrics_20251220_214552_combined", "prompt": [{"content": "\n    You are an intelligent memory assistant tasked with retrieving accurate information from conversation memories.\n\n    # CONTEXT:\n    You have access to memories from two speakers in a conversation. These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references unless instructed to keep them.\n\n    Memories for user Joanna:\n\n    [\n    \"2:34 pm on 10 July, 2022: Joanna appreciated Nate's belief in her and said she will keep doing her best, thanking him for his support.\",\n    \"2:12 pm on 5 June, 2022: Joanna appreciates Nate's help and support.

These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references unless instructed to keep them.\n\n    Memories for user Joanna:\n\n    [\n    \"8:16 pm on 25 October, 2022: Joanna contributed to a movie script that was shown on the big screen for the first time last Sunday (2022-10-23).\",\n    \"8:16 pm on 25 October, 2022: Joanna mentioned that this was the third time her script was shown on the big screen, and she found it awesome.\",\n    \"10:55 am on 24 June, 2022: Nate said that Joanna's screenplay submission is cool and that he hopes it does well (on 24 June, 2022).\",\n    \"7:31 pm on 21 January, 2022: Joanna first watched the romantic drama around 3 years ago (relative to 2022-01-21, i.e., 2019-01-21).\",\n    \"2:01 pm on 21 October, 2022: Joanna said: 'Thanks!

{"data_source": "evaluation_metrics_20251220_214552_combined", "prompt": [{"content": "\n    You are an intelligent memory assistant tasked with retrieving accurate information from conversation memories.\n\n    # CONTEXT:\n    You have access to memories from two speakers in a conversation. These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references unless instructed to keep them.\n\n    Memories for user Joanna:\n\n    [\n    \"1:43 pm on 14 September, 2022: Nate's favorite dish from the show is coconut milk ice cream, which is described as smooth and creamy with a tropical coconut twist and is dairy-free.\",\n    \"9:27 am on 7 February, 2022: Nate said he loves coconut milk, but also enjoys chocolate and mixed berry flavors.\",\n    \"9:27 am on 7 February, 2022: Nate found the coconut milk ice cream to be rich and creamy and might consider it his new favorite snack.\",\n    \"1:43 pm on 14 September, 2022: Nate praised Joanna's blueberry dessert and said he would try it.\",\n    \"3:56 pm on 4 November, 2022: Nate expressed interest in trying Joanna's chocolate and raspberry cake.\",\n    \"1:07 pm on 25 February, 2022: Nate made chocolate and vanilla swirl ice cream.\",\n    \"9:27 am on 7 February, 2022: Nate said that a snack was super good, rich, and creamy, and might be his new favorite snack.\",\n    \"9:27 am on 7 February, 2022: Joanna said it sounds great and asked if Nate has any favorite flavors for dairy-free desserts.\",\n    \"6:12 pm on 14 August, 2022: Nate shared an image of a dessert with whipped cream and chocolate sauce; image: https://i2.pickpik.com/photos/798/109/80/ice-cream-sundae-ice-cream-sundae-vanilla-preview.jpg; title: a photography of a dessert with whipped cream and chocolate sauce.\",\n    \"11:54 am on 2 May, 2022: Nate complimented Joanna's cake, saying it looks amazing and that he bet it tastes great, and called her talented at making dairy-free desserts.\",\n    \"1:07 pm on 25 February, 2022: Nate appreciates Joanna's feedback and enjoys that she likes his baked desserts.\",\n    \"1:43 pm on 14 September, 2022: Nate said he would try Joanna's chocolate cake recipe.\",\n    \"9:27 am on 7 February, 2022: Nate mentioned he made a dairy-free chocolate cake with berries on it the other day (time relative to a specific day: 'the other day').\",\n    \"6:12 pm on 14 August, 2022: Joanna thanked Nate for sharing his love for dairy-free desserts and accepted his offer to try the recipe.\",\n    \"9:27 am on 7 February, 2022: Joanna found Nate's cake recipe to be yummy and complimented his talent.\",\n    \"1:07 pm on 25 February, 2022: Nate is enthusiastic about desserts and is looking forward to Joanna's feedback.\",\n    \"6:03 pm on 5 September, 2022: Nate said, 'Woah, those look great, Joanna!

{"data_source": "evaluation_metrics_20251220_214552_combined", "prompt": [{"content": "\n    You are an intelligent memory assistant tasked with retrieving accurate information from conversation memories.\n\n    # CONTEXT:\n    You have access to memories from two speakers in a conversation. These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references unless instructed to keep them.\n\n    Memories for user Joanna:\n\n    [\n    \"1:43 pm on 14 September, 2022: Nate taught vegan ice cream recipes on his cooking show last Monday (time relative to a specific day: 'last Monday relative to 2022-09-14').\",\n    \"10:55 am on 24 June, 2022: Nate mentioned that he made vegan ice cream last Friday and shared it with some people in his vegan diet group.\",\n    \"10:55 am on 24 June, 2022: Joanna asked Nate for the recipe for the vegan ice cream, saying it sounds like a good recipe.\",\n    \"6:44 pm on 17 April, 2022: Nate offers to share the recipe for his ice cream.

These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6.

{"data_source": "evaluation_metrics_20251220_214552_combined", "prompt": [{"content": "\n    You are an intelligent memory assistant tasked with retrieving accurate information from conversation memories.\n\n    # CONTEXT:\n    You have access to memories from two speakers in a conversation. These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references unless instructed to keep them.\n\n    Memories for user Joanna:\n\n    [\n    \"10:55 am on 24 June, 2022: Nate said that Joanna's screenplay submission is cool and that he hopes it does well (on 24 June, 2022).\",\n    \"11:15 am on 6 October, 2022: Joanna finished her writing for her book last week (time relative to a specific day: '6 October, 2022'), which involved late nights and edits, and she is proud of her accomplishment.\",\n    \"8:16 pm on 25 October, 2022: Joanna contributed to a movie script that was shown on the big screen for the first time last Sunday (2022-10-23).\",\n    \"10:55 am on 24 June, 2022: Nate responded to Joanna's message, acknowledging that submitting a screenplay to a film festival is a big deal.

{"data_source": "evaluation_metrics_20251220_214552_combined", "prompt": [{"content": "\n    You are an intelligent memory assistant tasked with retrieving accurate information from conversation memories.\n\n    # CONTEXT:\n    You have access to memories from two speakers in a conversation. These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6.

{"data_source": "evaluation_metrics_20251220_214552_combined", "prompt": [{"content": "\n    You are an intelligent memory assistant tasked with retrieving accurate information from conversation memories.\n\n    # CONTEXT:\n    You have access to memories from two speakers in a conversation. These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references unless instructed to keep them.\n\n    Memories for user Joanna:\n\n    [\n    \"2:01 pm on 23 January, 2022: Nate recommends having pets like turtles for times of stress.\",\n    \"5:54 pm on 9 November, 2022: Nate explained that he saw another turtle at a pet store and had to get him because the tank is now big enough for three.\",\n    \"6:44 pm on 17 April, 2022: Nate mentions that he loves watching the turtles play and enjoys the peaceful moments of life, sometimes even bringing them into the kitchen to watch him make food.

These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references unless instructed to keep them.\n\n    Memories for user Joanna:\n\n    [\n    \"6:44 pm on 17 April, 2022: Nate mentions that he loves watching the turtles play and enjoys the peaceful moments of life, sometimes even bringing them into the kitchen to watch him make food.

{"data_source": "evaluation_metrics_20251220_214552_combined", "prompt": [{"content": "\n    You are an intelligent memory assistant tasked with retrieving accurate information from conversation memories.\n\n    # CONTEXT:\n    You have access to memories from two speakers in a conversation. These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references unless instructed to keep them.\n\n    Memories for user Joanna:\n\n    [\n    \"7:31 pm on 21 January, 2022: Nate loves action and sci-fi movies because of the cool effects.\",\n    \"8:10 pm on 7 November, 2022: Nate said/claims that his favorite game is 'Xeonoblade Chronicles', a fantasy RPG, and that it has been a blast to play\",\n    \"7:44 pm on 21 April, 2022: Nate said that this trilogy is one of his favorites because of its world building, battles, and storytelling; image: https://i.redd.it/7vtqewbtg181.jpg; title: a photo of a shelf with a lot of books on it\",\n    \"7:31 pm on 21 January, 2022: Nate mentioned he loves watching classics.\",\n    \"10:57 am on 22 August, 2022: Nate recommended the series to Joanna, highlighting its action scenes and plot as awesome and stating it is one of his favorites.\",\n    \"11:15 am on 6 October, 2022: Nate recently watched 'Little Women' and found it great, praising the acting and the captivating story.\",\n    \"8:10 pm on 7 November, 2022: Nate agreed and said he usually likes movie recommendations from Joanna more than random ones.\",\n    \"9:27 am on 7 February, 2022: Nate expressed enthusiasm about adding a movie to his list and thanked Joanna for the recommendation.\",\n    \"7:31 pm on 21 January, 2022: Nate expressed interest in checking out a romantic drama that Joanna recommended.\",\n    \"1:43 pm on 14 September, 2022: Nate's favorite dish from the show is coconut milk ice cream, which is described as smooth and creamy with a tropical coconut twist and is dairy-free.\",\n    \"5:54 pm on 9 November, 2022: Joanna advised Nate to read lots of books and try different genres, build a solid understanding of literature, practice writing, gather feedback, and have faith in himself to follow his writing dreams.

These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6.

{"data_source": "evaluation_metrics_20251220_214552_combined", "prompt": [{"content": "\n    You are an intelligent memory assistant tasked with retrieving accurate information from conversation memories.\n\n    # CONTEXT:\n    You have access to memories from two speakers in a conversation. These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references unless instructed to keep them.\n\n    Memories for user Joanna:\n\n    [\n    \"11:54 am on 2 May, 2022: Joanna described the cake as dairy-free vanilla with strawberry filling and coconut cream frosting.\",\n    \"6:03 pm on 5 September, 2022: Joanna revised one of her old recipes and made a dessert with strawberries and chocolate; she shared an image of it.

These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6.

{"data_source": "evaluation_metrics_20251220_214552_combined", "prompt": [{"content": "\n    You are an intelligent memory assistant tasked with retrieving accurate information from conversation memories.\n\n    # CONTEXT:\n    You have access to memories from two speakers in a conversation. These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references unless instructed to keep them.\n\n    Memories for user Joanna:\n\n    [\n    \"10:55 am on 24 June, 2022: Nate said that the gaming party was a great success and that they played Chess afterward for fun (on 24 June, 2022).\",\n    \"10:55 am on 24 June, 2022: Nate said that 7 people attended the gaming party and that 6 of them said they'd want to do it again next month (on 24 June, 2022).

{"data_source": "evaluation_metrics_20251220_214552_combined", "prompt": [{"content": "\n    You are an intelligent memory assistant tasked with retrieving accurate information from conversation memories.\n\n    # CONTEXT:\n    You have access to memories from two speakers in a conversation. These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references unless instructed to keep them.\n\n    Memories for user Joanna:\n\n    [\n    \"5:44 pm on 3 June, 2022: Nate mentioned he is getting everyone custom controller decorations just for coming.\",\n    \"1:07 pm on 25 February, 2022: Nate made chocolate and vanilla swirl ice cream.\",\n    \"10:55 am on 24 June, 2022: Nate said that the gaming party was a great success and that they played Chess afterward for fun (on 24 June, 2022).\",\n    \"10:55 am on 24 June, 2022: Nate said that 7 people attended the gaming party and that 6 of them said they'd want to do it again next month (on 24 June, 2022).

{"data_source": "evaluation_metrics_20251220_214552_combined", "prompt": [{"content": "\n    You are an intelligent memory assistant tasked with retrieving accurate information from conversation memories.\n\n    # CONTEXT:\n    You have access to memories from two speakers in a conversation. These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references unless instructed to keep them.\n\n    Memories for user Joanna:\n\n    [\n    \"2:34 pm on 10 July, 2022: Joanna mentioned that

{"data_source": "evaluation_metrics_20251220_214552_combined", "prompt": [{"content": "\n    You are an intelligent memory assistant tasked with retrieving accurate information from conversation memories.\n\n    # CONTEXT:\n    You have access to memories from two speakers in a conversation. These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references unless instructed to keep them.\n\n    Memories for user Joanna:\n\n    [\n    \"2:34 pm on 10 July, 2022: Nate said that real-life stories are the best for inspiration and expressed excitement about hearing about Joanna's next script\",\n    \"10:55 am on 24 June, 2022: Nate said that Joanna's screenplay submission is cool and that he hopes it does well (on 24 June, 2022).\",\n    \"8:16 pm on 25 October, 2022: Joanna contributed to a movie script that was shown on the big screen for the first time last Sunday (2022-10-23).\",\n    \"2:34 pm on 10 July, 2022: Nate claimed that Joanna's new script will do just as well as her last one and encouraged her to keep trying and believe in herself\",\n    \"10:55 am on 24 June, 2022: Nate responded to Joanna's message, acknowledging that submitting a screenplay to a film festival is a big deal.

These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7.

{"data_source": "evaluation_metrics_20251220_214552_combined", "prompt": [{"content": "\n    You are an intelligent memory assistant tasked with retrieving accurate information from conversation memories.\n\n    # CONTEXT:\n    You have access to memories from two speakers in a conversation. These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references unless instructed to keep them.\n\n    Memories for user Joanna:\n\n    [\n    \"7:49 pm on 20 May, 2022: Joanna says writing and creative projects get her through tough times.\",\n    \"3:56 pm on 4 November, 2022: Joanna thanked Nate for his encouragement, noting that turtles make her think of strength and perseverance, which help motivate her in tough times.\",\n    \"7:49 pm on 20 May, 2022: Joanna found that she writes best when being true to herself, even if it's hard.\",\n    \"3:00 pm on 25 May, 2022: Joanna said thinking back to the tough times finishing her screenplay made her realize that moments bringing joy make the journey worth it.\",\n    \"10:58 am on 9 October, 2022: Nate encouraged Joanna to keep doing what makes him happy, emphasizing the importance of staying happy and de-stressing.\",\n    \"3:00 pm on 25 May, 2022: Joanna reflects on the tough times finishing her screenplay, realizing that those moments bring joy and make the journey worth it.\",\n    \"2:01 pm on 23 January, 2022: Nate encouraged Joanna to keep doing what she loves.\",\n    \"3:56 pm on 4 November, 2022: Joanna was inspired by stories about finding courage and taking risks even back when she was 10.\",\n    \"2:34 pm on 10 July, 2022: Nate claimed that Joanna's new script will do just as well as her last one and encouraged her to keep trying and believe in herself\",\n    \"11:54 am on 2 May, 2022: Nate encouraged Joanna to keep up her good work.\",\n    \"3:00 pm on 25 May, 2022: Nate agrees with Joanna, stating that little moments during tough times are important and that enjoying the ride is key.\",\n    \"6:59 pm on 18 March, 2022: Joanna stated that she has been researching and networking non-stop for her script, finding it tough but remaining determined\",\n    \"2:01 pm on 23 January, 2022: Nate acknowledged Joanna's joy in writing and hanging with friends as great things to help her get through times of anxiety despite not being able to have animals.\",\n    \"6:12 pm on 14 August, 2022: Joanna confirmed that writing has become an escape and a way to express her feelings.

{"data_source": "evaluation_metrics_20251220_214552_combined", "prompt": [{"content": "\n    You are an intelligent memory assistant tasked with retrieving accurate information from conversation memories.\n\n    # CONTEXT:\n    You have access to memories from two speakers in a conversation. These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4.

{"data_source": "evaluation_metrics_20251220_214552_combined", "prompt": [{"content": "\n    You are an intelligent memory assistant tasked with retrieving accurate information from conversation memories.\n\n    # CONTEXT:\n    You have access to memories from two speakers in a conversation. These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references unless instructed to keep them.\n\n    Memories for user Joanna:\n\n    [\n    \"2:01 pm on 21 October, 2022: Tilly is always with Joanna while she writes.\",\n    \"6:12 pm on 14 August, 2022: Joanna confirmed that writing has become an escape and a way to express her feelings.

{"data_source": "evaluation_metrics_20251220_214552_combined", "prompt": [{"content": "\n    You are an intelligent memory assistant tasked with retrieving accurate information from conversation memories.\n\n    # CONTEXT:\n    You have access to memories from two speakers in a conversation. These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references unless instructed to keep them.\n\n    Memories for user Joanna:\n\n    [\n    \"8:16 pm on 25 October, 2022: Joanna mentioned that her ideas for characters come from everywhere, including people she knows, things she saw, and her imagination, and she finds it cool to see how an idea takes shape into a person with their own wants, worries, and wishes\",\n    \"8:16 pm on 25 October, 2022: Nate found it cool that Joanna gains insight into her characters through drawing and asked where she got her ideas for them\",\n    \"1:07 pm on 25 February, 2022: Joanna finds inspiration in writing screenplays similar to her previous one.\",\n    \"8:16 pm on 25 October, 2022: Joanna explained that her drawings are visuals of characters to help her bring them alive in her head so she can write better\",\n    \"2:34 pm on 10 July, 2022: Joanna mentioned that Woodhaven has had an interesting past with lots of cool people, and that seeing how much it changed sparked ideas for her next script\",\n    \"8:16 pm on 25 October, 2022: Joanna's favorite part of her work is seeing her characters come alive, as they felt like they jumped off the page and became real, which she described as surreal; image: https://i.redd.it/ioa9eysnr9xb1.jpg; title: a photo of a drawing book with a bunch of drawings on it\",\n    \"8:16 pm on 25 October, 2022: Joanna agreed with Nate's idea and expressed that she is already invested in the turtles.

{"data_source": "evaluation_metrics_20251220_214552_combined", "prompt": [{"content": "\n    You are an intelligent memory assistant tasked with retrieving accurate information from conversation memories.\n\n    # CONTEXT:\n    You have access to memories from two speakers in a conversation. These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references unless instructed to keep them.\n\n    Memories for user Joanna:\n\n    [\n    \"3:56 pm on 4 November, 2022: Nate found it fun to help with the high scores (event occurred on 4 November, 2022).\",\n    \"3:56 pm on 4 November, 2022: Nate invited Joanna to come over and try some ice cream that he made (event occurred on 4 November, 2022).\",\n    \"3:56 pm on 4 November, 2022: Joanna agreed that Nate's actions were passionate and felt good to make a difference (event occurred on 4 November, 2022).\",\n    \"3:56 pm on 4 November, 2022: Nate helped some friends reset their high scores at the international tournament (event occurred on 4 November, 2022).\",\n    \"2:01 pm on 21 October, 2022: Nate said: 'No problem!

{"data_source": "evaluation_metrics_20251220_214552_combined", "prompt": [{"content": "\n    You are an intelligent memory assistant tasked with retrieving accurate information from conversation memories.\n\n    # CONTEXT:\n    You have access to memories from two speakers in a conversation. These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references unless instructed to keep them.\n\n    Memories for user Joanna:\n\n    [\n    \"5:54 pm on 9 November, 2022: Joanna said it's great to support each other in reaching goals and shared a sunset photo she took on a hike last summer near Fort Wayne; image: https://i.redd.it/ap48tronzy41.jpg; title: a photo of a sunflower in a field with a sunset in the background\",\n    \"3:35 pm on 12 May, 2022: Joanna took a picture at Whispering Falls, a beautiful location described as peaceful and serene (image: <URL>; title: <text>).\",\n    \"3:35 pm on 12 May, 2022: Nate complimented the photo and asked Joanna where she took it, noting the dark sky and green scenery\",\n    \"5:44 pm on 3 June, 2022: Nate told Joanna to have a great hike and take lots of pictures, and said goodbye.\",\n    \"3:35 pm on 12 May, 2022: Joanna confirmed she took photos and mentioned loving a specific spot on the hike with a soothing rush of water; image: https://burst.shopifycdn.com/photos/large-rolling-waterfall-though-a-lush-green-hill.jpg; title: a photo of a waterfall with a dark sky in the background\",\n    \"3:35 pm on 12 May, 2022: Nate asked Joanna if she took any photos of the hiking experience\",\n    \"7:37 pm on 15 April, 2022: Joanna mentioned a photo of a street with a stop sign and a cloudy sky (image: https://i.redd.it/ruvtfm6ixchb1.jpg)\",\n    \"3:35 pm on 12 May, 2022: Joanna mentioned that she went hiking and found some more amazing trails in her town on 12 May, 2022 (vague time expression: 'quite a week since we last talked')\",\n    \"7:37 pm on 15 April, 2022: Joanna was inspired by a sunset she saw while hiking the other day (time relative to a specific day: 'the other day')\",\n    \"2:12 pm on 5 June, 2022: Nate asked Joanna to show him a picture of her cork board.\",\n    \"8:16 pm on 25 October, 2022: Joanna contributed to a movie script that was shown on the big screen for the first time last Sunday (2022-10-23).\",\n    \"8:16 pm on 25 October, 2022: Joanna refused to reveal more about the character on the left in the photo, saying that viewers will have to watch the movie to find out.

These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references unless instructed to keep them.\n\n    Memories for user Joanna:\n\n    [\n    \"5:54 pm on 9 November, 2022: Nate explained that he saw another turtle at a pet store and had to get him because the tank is now big enough for three.\",\n    \"5:54 pm on 9 November, 2022: Joanna asked Nate what made him get a third turtle.\",\n    \"5:54 pm on 9 November, 2022: Joanna remarked that it's always a shock where life will take us next and that Nate probably wouldn't have thought of getting a third turtle last week.\",\n    \"5:54 pm on 9 November, 2022: Nate commented on the sunset photo, saying it was incredible and that moments like those remind him to appreciate nature's beauty.

{"data_source": "evaluation_metrics_20251220_214552_combined", "prompt": [{"content": "\n    You are an intelligent memory assistant tasked with retrieving accurate information from conversation memories.\n\n    # CONTEXT:\n    You have access to memories from two speakers in a conversation. These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references unless instructed to keep them.\n\n    Memories for user Joanna:\n\n    [\n    \"3:56 pm on 4 November, 2022: Nate invited Joanna to come over and try some ice cream that he made (event occurred on 4 November, 2022).\",\n    \"9:27 am on 7 February, 2022: Nate said he would reach out to Joanna when he runs out of things to watch.\",\n    \"5:54 pm on 9 November, 2022: Nate plans to bathe the turtles before Joanna arrives so they're ready to play.\",\n    \"10:58 am on 9 October, 2022: Nate asks Joanna for pointers on making his living room comfy like hers.\",\n    \"1:43 pm on 14 September, 2022: Nate complimented Joanna's dessert and expressed intent to try it; Joanna responded by saying she was glad to help and asked Nate to let her know if he tried it, predicting he would enjoy it; Nate thanked Joanna and confirmed he would let her know, then said goodbye.\",\n    \"10:58 am on 9 October, 2022: Nate acknowledges Joanna's advice and says he will try it out.\",\n    \"5:54 pm on 9 November, 2022: Joanna advised Nate to read lots of books and try different genres, build a solid understanding of literature, practice writing, gather feedback, and have faith in himself to follow his writing dreams.
