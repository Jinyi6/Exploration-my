These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories from both speakers.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (原文指8月的一个月之前)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June/六月初”, “第一个周末”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (如逝者名单、车数、roadtrip 次数、共同点等).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories from both speakers. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7.

{"data_source": "evaluation_metrics_20251206_161211_combined", "prompt": [{"content": "\n    You are an intelligent memory assistant tasked with retrieving accurate information from conversation memories.\n\n    # CONTEXT:\n    You have access to memories from two speakers in a conversation. These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories from both speakers.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (原文指8月的一个月之前)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June/六月初”, “第一个周末”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (如逝者名单、车数、roadtrip 次数、共同点等).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories from both speakers. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references unless instructed to keep them.\n\n    Memories for user Tim:\n\n    [\n    \"1:41 pm on 12 January, 2024: John recommended Barcelona as a must-visit city, highlighting its culture, architecture, food, and nearby beaches (originally stated as 1:41 pm on 12 January, 2024).\",\n    \"1:41 pm on 12 January, 2024: Tim thanked John for the advice and said he would keep him in the loop about his travels (originally stated as 1:41 pm on 12 January, 2024).\",\n    \"1:41 pm on 12 January, 2024: Tim finds Barcelona awesome and decides to add it to his travel list (1:41 pm on 12 January, 2024).\",\n    \"1:41 pm on 12 January, 2024: John offers to help Tim with any other questions or travel-related needs (1:41 pm on 12 January, 2024).\",\n    \"1:41 pm on 12 January, 2024: John praised Tim for taking initiative, stating it is a must if one wants to achieve their goals (originally stated as 1:41 pm on 12 January, 2024).\",\n    \"1:41 pm on 12 January, 2024: Tim said goodbye to John (1:41 pm on 12 January, 2024).\",\n    \"1:41 pm on 12 January, 2024: Tim says he owes John one and offers to help him in return (1:41 pm on 12 January, 2024).\",\n    \"6:59 pm on 26 August, 2023: John offered to help Tim with planning his visit to NYC\",\n    \"8:17 pm on 21 September, 2023: John asked Tim for book recommendations for his trip (discussed on 2023-09-21).\",\n    \"8:17 pm on 21 September, 2023: Tim advised John to pick endorsements that align with his values and brand and feel authentic to his followers (discussed on 2023-09-21).\",\n    \"3:35 pm on 26 December, 2023: John offered to help Tim when they let him know about their plans (on 26 August, 2023 at 6:59 pm).
