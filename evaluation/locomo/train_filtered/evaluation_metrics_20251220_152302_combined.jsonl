These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7.

Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references unless instructed to keep them.\n\n    Memories for user Audrey:\n\n    [\n    \"5:23 pm on 13 June, 2023: Audrey invited Andrew to join her and her pups for a walk in the park.\",\n    \"7:49 pm on 6 September, 2023: Audrey organized a doggy playdate with the neighbors' dogs (recently happened).\",\n    \"5:41 pm on 3 May, 2023: Andrew asked where Audrey found the playdates for her dogs\",\n    \"8:32 pm on 3 July, 2023: Audrey said her dogs give her love and happiness\",\n    \"5:41 pm on 3 May, 2023: Andrew asked Audrey if her dogs enjoy going on hikes.\",\n    \"5:41 pm on 3 May, 2023: Audrey said the dog park is a great place to start for playdates because the dogs can run and mingle with other pooches and it's a fun spot for playdates; image: https://live.staticflickr.com/2913/14439335660_d4ffd00bbc_z.jpg; title: a photography of a dog jumping through a ring in a park\",\n    \"5:53 pm on 24 September, 2023: Audrey had a doggy playdate last Friday.

{"data_source": "evaluation_metrics_20251220_152302_combined", "prompt": [{"content": "\n    You are an intelligent memory assistant tasked with retrieving accurate information from conversation memories.\n\n    # CONTEXT:\n    You have access to memories from two speakers in a conversation. These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references unless instructed to keep them.\n\n    Memories for user Audrey:\n\n    [\n    \"7:59 pm on 4 November, 2023: Audrey recently joined a dog owners group to learn how to better take care of her dogs.\",\n    \"8:32 pm on 3 July, 2023: Audrey said her dogs give her love and happiness\",\n    \"2:36 pm on 28 October, 2023: Audrey is hopeful that the new approach will help with the dogs' problems\",\n    \"2:36 pm on 28 October, 2023: Audrey made an appointment with an animal behaviorist last Wed (originally stated as last Wed relative to 2023-10-28, i.e., 2023-10-25)\",\n    \"2:36 pm on 28 October, 2023: Andrew asked Audrey how her dogs were doing with the new approach\",\n    \"11:27 am on 2 June, 2023: Audrey took her pups to the park yesterday (originally stated as yesterday relative to 2023-06-02, i.e., 2023-06-01), where they ran around and played without a leash, which Audrey found awesome and brought her peace and joy.\",\n    \"12:24 am on 24 August, 2023: Audrey said taking care of her dogs is a big deal and makes her really happy, which she takes seriously despite it being tough and super rewarding.\",\n    \"12:24 am on 24 August, 2023: Andrew praised Audrey for taking care of the dogs, emphasizing that keeping them healthy and happy is key.\",\n    \"5:53 pm on 24 September, 2023: Last Friday (originally stated as '6 May, 2023'), Audrey took a road trip to a beautiful national park, and her dogs had a blast; Audrey had an incident last Friday (time relative to a specific day: 'last Friday') at the park where one of her pups pulled hard on the leash, causing it to break; image: https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/2/24/Dog_leash.JPG; title: a photography of a red retractable leash with a black handle\",\n    \"12:24 am on 24 August, 2023: Audrey agreed, stating that taking care of the dogs is a big deal and makes her happy, though it can be tough, it is super rewarding.\",\n    \"7:09 pm on 1 October, 2023: Audrey said she took them to the dog park nearby last Saturday (originally stated as last Saturday relative to 2023-10-01, i.e., 2023-09-23).\",\n    \"4:22 pm on 13 October, 2023: Audrey said seeing her dogs happy fills her heart with joy and they bring her happiness.
