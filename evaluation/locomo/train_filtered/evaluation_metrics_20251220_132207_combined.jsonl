{"data_source": "evaluation_metrics_20251220_132207_combined", "prompt": [{"content": "\n    You are an intelligent memory assistant tasked with retrieving accurate information from conversation memories.\n\n    # CONTEXT:\n    You have access to memories from two speakers in a conversation. These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references unless instructed to keep them.\n\n    Memories for user Caroline:\n\n    [\n    \"10:31 am on 13 October, 2023: Caroline suggested researching adoption agencies or lawyers, gathering documents like references, financial info, and medical checks, and preparing emotionally for the process.\",\n    \"1:14 pm on 25 May, 2023: Caroline is researching adoption agencies as it has been her dream to have a family and give a loving home to kids who need it.\",\n    \"1:56 pm on 8 May, 2023: Caroline agreed with Melanie about the importance of relaxing and expressing oneself, and mentioned she was off to do some research.\",\n    \"4:33 pm on 12 July, 2023: Caroline started looking into counseling and mental health career options to help others on their journeys, similar to how she was helped.\",\n    \"10:37 am on 27 June, 2023: Caroline is pursuing counseling and mental health services focused on working with trans people to help them accept themselves and support their mental health.\",\n    \"8:18 pm on 6 July, 2023: Caroline is interested in counseling or mental health work and finds it rewarding despite the challenges; she is passionate about helping people and making a positive impact.\",\n    \"7:55 pm on 9 June, 2023: Caroline believes that by working together, people can build a more inclusive and understanding world.\",\n    \"2:31 pm on 17 July, 2023: Caroline and her mentee have been working on building confidence and finding positive strategies.\",\n    \"4:33 pm on 12 July, 2023: Caroline met and connected with people who have gone through similar journeys at the LGBTQ conference.\",\n    \"1:50 pm on 17 August, 2023: Caroline responded positively to Melanie's suggestion and proposed planning something special for the summer just for the two of them, suggesting it would be a great chance to catch up and explore nature.\",\n    \"7:55 pm on 9 June, 2023: Caroline emphasized the necessity of conversations about gender identity and inclusion\",\n    \"10:37 am on 27 June, 2023: Caroline attended an LGBTQ+ counseling workshop last Friday (time relative to a specific day: 'last Friday'), which was enlightening and discussed different therapeutic methods for working with trans individuals.\",\n    \"12:09 am on 13 September, 2023: Caroline created a piece of art for a local church that represents how time changes our lives and shows her own journey as a transgender woman, emphasizing acceptance of growth and change.

{"data_source": "evaluation_metrics_20251220_132207_combined", "prompt": [{"content": "\n    You are an intelligent memory assistant tasked with retrieving accurate information from conversation memories.\n\n    # CONTEXT:\n    You have access to memories from two speakers in a conversation. These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references unless instructed to keep them.\n\n    Memories for user Caroline:\n\n    [\n    \"10:37 am on 27 June, 2023: Caroline is pursuing counseling and mental health services focused on working with trans people to help them accept themselves and support their mental health.\",\n    \"4:33 pm on 12 July, 2023: Caroline is interested in jobs in counseling or mental health, as she wants to support people with similar issues.\",\n    \"10:37 am on 27 June, 2023: Melanie asked Caroline about the specific kind of counseling and mental health services she wants to pursue\",\n    \"1:56 pm on 8 May, 2023: Caroline plans to continue her education and explore career options, which she finds exciting.\",\n    \"10:37 am on 27 June, 2023: Caroline's motivation for pursuing counseling stems from her own journey and the support she received, which made a significant difference in her life.\",\n    \"8:18 pm on 6 July, 2023: Caroline is interested in counseling or mental health work and finds it rewarding despite the challenges; she is passionate about helping people and making a positive impact.\",\n    \"10:37 am on 27 June, 2023: Melanie congratulated Caroline for pursuing her interests and caring about mental health.\",\n    \"10:37 am on 27 June, 2023: Melanie expressed support for Caroline's career interest in counseling and mental health\",\n    \"10:37 am on 27 June, 2023: Melanie praised Caroline for her dedication to helping others and for her impressive work in the field.\",\n    \"4:33 pm on 12 July, 2023: Caroline started looking into counseling and mental health career options to help others on their journeys, similar to how she was helped.\",\n    \"3:19 pm on 28 August, 2023: Caroline plans to continue volunteering at the youth center because it is an important part of her life and she has made strong connections with people there.\",\n    \"1:50 pm on 17 August, 2023: Caroline responded positively to Melanie's suggestion and proposed planning something special for the summer just for the two of them, suggesting it would be a great chance to catch up and explore nature.\",\n    \"10:37 am on 27 June, 2023: Caroline wants to help others through counseling and support groups, as she saw how they improved her life and helped her understand herself.\",\n    \"10:31 am on 13 October, 2023: Caroline suggested researching adoption agencies or lawyers, gathering documents like references, financial info, and medical checks, and preparing emotionally for the process.\",\n    \"10:37 am on 27 June, 2023: Caroline is passionate about creating a safe and inviting place for people to grow.\",\n    \"2:31 pm on 17 July, 2023: Caroline and her mentee have been working on building confidence and finding positive strategies.\",\n    \"7:55 pm on 9 June, 2023: Caroline encouraged students to get involved in the LGBTQ community during her school event last week (time relative to a specific day: 'last week')\",\n    \"2:31 pm on 17 July, 2023: Caroline mentors a transgender teen similar to herself.\",\n    \"1:33 pm on 25 August, 2023: Caroline agrees with Melanie that art can be found in unlikely places and can be a mood-booster.

{"data_source": "evaluation_metrics_20251220_132207_combined", "prompt": [{"content": "\n    You are an intelligent memory assistant tasked with retrieving accurate information from conversation memories.\n\n    # CONTEXT:\n    You have access to memories from two speakers in a conversation. These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references unless instructed to keep them.\n\n    Memories for user Caroline:\n\n    [\n    \"10:31 am on 13 October, 2023: Caroline contacted her mentor for adoption advice on 13 October, 2023, 10:31 am.\",\n    \"7:55 pm on 9 June, 2023: Caroline mentioned that her friends, family, and mentors are her main sources of motivation and strength.\",\n    \"2:31 pm on 17 July, 2023: Caroline joined a mentorship program for LGBTQ youth last weekend (originally stated as last weekend relative to 2023-07-17, i.e., 2023-07-15).\",\n    \"1:56 pm on 8 May, 2023: Caroline attended an LGBTQ support group on 2023-05-07 (originally stated as yesterday relative to 2023-05-08).\",\n    \"10:31 am on 13 October, 2023: Caroline is ready to be a mom and wants to share her love and family on 13 October, 2023, 10:31 am.\",\n    \"7:55 pm on 9 June, 2023: Caroline shared an image from when they met up last week (time relative to a specific day: 'last week'); image: https://fox2now.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/14/2023/08/that-tall-family.jpg; title: a photo of a family posing for a picture in a yard.\",\n    \"9:55 am on 22 October, 2023: Caroline explained that friends, family, and people she looked up to boosted her through tough times and helped her find out who she really is.\",\n    \"2:31 pm on 17 July, 2023: Caroline finds the mentoring experience rewarding and has met some amazing young folks.\",\n    \"8:18 pm on 6 July, 2023: Melanie asked Caroline how her friends and family have been helping her with her transition.

These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references unless instructed to keep them.\n\n    Memories for user Caroline:\n\n    [\n    \"1:51 pm on 15 July, 2023: Melanie mentioned that her kids are excited about summer break and that they are thinking about going camping next month.

{"data_source": "evaluation_metrics_20251220_132207_combined", "prompt": [{"content": "\n    You are an intelligent memory assistant tasked with retrieving accurate information from conversation memories.\n\n    # CONTEXT:\n    You have access to memories from two speakers in a conversation. These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references unless instructed to keep them.\n\n    Memories for user Caroline:\n\n    [\n    \"4:33 pm on 12 July, 2023: Melanie stated that her new shoes are for running and that she has been running longer since their last chat, which she finds a great way to destress and clear her mind\",\n    \"2:24 pm on 14 August, 2023: Melanie praised the healing power of art and its ability to connect individuals with their true selves, noting that beauty can be found in imperfections and that everyone is individual and wonderfully imperfect\",\n    \"1:51 pm on 15 July, 2023: Melanie said that creativity and family keep her at peace.\",\n    \"6:55 pm on 20 October, 2023: Melanie said they're really amazing and wished she was that resilient too, but they give her the strength to keep going.\",\n    \"8:56 pm on 20 July, 2023: Melanie appreciates special moments like these that make her appreciate life and the love she has with her family.\",\n    \"1:50 pm on 17 August, 2023: Melanie said painting is a fun way to express her feelings and get creative, and that it helps her relax after a long day.

{"data_source": "evaluation_metrics_20251220_132207_combined", "prompt": [{"content": "\n    You are an intelligent memory assistant tasked with retrieving accurate information from conversation memories.\n\n    # CONTEXT:\n    You have access to memories from two speakers in a conversation. These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references unless instructed to keep them.\n\n    Memories for user Caroline:\n\n    [\n    \"1:36 pm on 3 July, 2023: Melanie thanked Caroline and said she is excited to see where pottery takes her.

{"data_source": "evaluation_metrics_20251220_132207_combined", "prompt": [{"content": "\n    You are an intelligent memory assistant tasked with retrieving accurate information from conversation memories.\n\n    # CONTEXT:\n    You have access to memories from two speakers in a conversation. These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references unless instructed to keep them.\n\n    Memories for user Caroline:\n\n    [\n    \"1:51 pm on 15 July, 2023: Melanie mentioned that her kids are excited about summer break and that they are thinking about going camping next month.

{"data_source": "evaluation_metrics_20251220_132207_combined", "prompt": [{"content": "\n    You are an intelligent memory assistant tasked with retrieving accurate information from conversation memories.\n\n    # CONTEXT:\n    You have access to memories from two speakers in a conversation. These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references unless instructed to keep them.\n\n    Memories for user Caroline:\n\n    [\n    \"2:31 pm on 17 July, 2023: Caroline joined a mentorship program for LGBTQ youth last weekend (originally stated as last weekend relative to 2023-07-17, i.e., 2023-07-15).\",\n    \"1:56 pm on 8 May, 2023: Caroline attended an LGBTQ support group on 2023-05-07 (originally stated as yesterday relative to 2023-05-08).\",\n    \"10:31 am on 13 October, 2023: Caroline contacted her mentor for adoption advice on 13 October, 2023, 10:31 am.\",\n    \"8:56 pm on 20 July, 2023: Caroline joined a new LGBTQ activist group last Tues (originally stated as last Tues relative to 2023-07-20, i.e., 2023-07-18).\",\n    \"4:33 pm on 12 July, 2023: Caroline attended an LGBTQ conference two days ago (originally stated as two days ago relative to 2023-07-12, i.e., 2023-07-10) and found it to be a special and welcoming environment where she felt accepted.\",\n    \"2:31 pm on 17 July, 2023: Caroline finds the mentoring experience rewarding and has met some amazing young folks.\",\n    \"3:19 pm on 28 August, 2023: Caroline volunteered at an LGBTQ+ youth center.

{"data_source": "evaluation_metrics_20251220_132207_combined", "prompt": [{"content": "\n    You are an intelligent memory assistant tasked with retrieving accurate information from conversation memories.\n\n    # CONTEXT:\n    You have access to memories from two speakers in a conversation. These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references unless instructed to keep them.\n\n    Memories for user Caroline:\n\n    [\n    \"1:36 pm on 3 July, 2023: Melanie said that pottery is a huge part of her life, not just a hobby, and that it helps her express her emotions and brings her joy.\",\n    \"2:24 pm on 14 August, 2023: Melanie commented on the painting in the image and expressed admiration for Caroline finding a helpful group.

These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references unless instructed to keep them.\n\n    Memories for user Caroline:\n\n    [\n    \"3:31 pm on 23 August, 2023: Caroline applied to adoption agencies this week (originally stated as this week relative to 2023-08-23) as the first step towards becoming a mom; she feels excited but nerve-wracking about the decision and believes she is ready to give all her love to a child.

These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references unless instructed to keep them.\n\n    Memories for user Caroline:\n\n    [\n    \"12:09 am on 13 September, 2023: Caroline's journey as a trans woman has affected her relationships, with some close friends continuing to support her while others struggled to accept her.\",\n    \"7:55 pm on 9 June, 2023: Caroline mentioned that she has received lots of love and support throughout her transition and wants to pass it on to others\",\n    \"12:09 am on 13 September, 2023: Melanie asked Caroline what the support group has done for her.

These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7.

{"data_source": "evaluation_metrics_20251220_132207_combined", "prompt": [{"content": "\n    You are an intelligent memory assistant tasked with retrieving accurate information from conversation memories.\n\n    # CONTEXT:\n    You have access to memories from two speakers in a conversation. These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references unless instructed to keep them.\n\n    Memories for user Caroline:\n\n    [\n    \"10:37 am on 27 June, 2023: Caroline attended an LGBTQ+ counseling workshop last Friday (time relative to a specific day: 'last Friday'), which was enlightening and discussed different therapeutic methods for working with trans individuals.\",\n    \"4:33 pm on 12 July, 2023: Caroline attended an LGBTQ conference two days ago (originally stated as two days ago relative to 2023-07-12, i.e., 2023-07-10) and found it to be a special and welcoming environment where she felt accepted.\",\n    \"7:55 pm on 9 June, 2023: Caroline talked about her transgender journey during a school event last week (time relative to a specific day: 'last week')\",\n    \"1:56 pm on 8 May, 2023: Caroline attended an LGBTQ support group on 2023-05-07 (originally stated as yesterday relative to 2023-05-08).\",\n    \"2:31 pm on 17 July, 2023: Caroline and her mentee had a great time at an LGBT pride event last month (originally stated as last month relative to 2023-07-17, i.e., June 2023).\",\n    \"1:36 pm on 3 July, 2023: Caroline is going to a transgender conference this month (vague time expression: 'this month')\",\n    \"7:55 pm on 9 June, 2023: Caroline encouraged students to get involved in the LGBTQ community during her school event last week (time relative to a specific day: 'last week')\",\n    \"7:55 pm on 9 June, 2023: Melanie said Caroline's event was amazing and expressed pride in her for spreading awareness and getting others involved in the LGBTQ community\",\n    \"4:33 pm on 12 July, 2023: Caroline met and connected with people who have gone through similar journeys at the LGBTQ conference.\",\n    \"3:19 pm on 28 August, 2023: Caroline volunteered at an LGBTQ+ youth center.

{"data_source": "evaluation_metrics_20251220_132207_combined", "prompt": [{"content": "\n    You are an intelligent memory assistant tasked with retrieving accurate information from conversation memories.\n\n    # CONTEXT:\n    You have access to memories from two speakers in a conversation. These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7.

These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references unless instructed to keep them.\n\n    Memories for user Caroline:\n\n    [\n    \"1:51 pm on 15 July, 2023: Melanie mentioned that her kids are excited about summer break and that they are thinking about going camping next month.

{"data_source": "evaluation_metrics_20251220_132207_combined", "prompt": [{"content": "\n    You are an intelligent memory assistant tasked with retrieving accurate information from conversation memories.\n\n    # CONTEXT:\n    You have access to memories from two speakers in a conversation. These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references unless instructed to keep them.\n\n    Memories for user Caroline:\n\n    [\n    \"10:37 am on 27 June, 2023: Melanie's family includes two younger kids who love nature\",\n    \"8:56 pm on 20 July, 2023: Melanie said that she and her kids recently went to the beach, and it was awesome; image: https://mdkidadventures.files.wordpress.com/2023/06/img_2130.jpg; title: a photo of three children playing on the beach with a kite.\",\n    \"7:55 pm on 9 June, 2023: Melanie said she has been married for 5 years.\",\n    \"1:51 pm on 15 July, 2023: Melanie mentioned that her kids are excited about summer break and that they are thinking about going camping next month.

These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7.

{"data_source": "evaluation_metrics_20251220_132207_combined", "prompt": [{"content": "\n    You are an intelligent memory assistant tasked with retrieving accurate information from conversation memories.\n\n    # CONTEXT:\n    You have access to memories from two speakers in a conversation. These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references unless instructed to keep them.\n\n    Memories for user Caroline:\n\n    [\n    \"10:31 am on 13 October, 2023: Caroline contacted her mentor for adoption advice on 13 October, 2023, 10:31 am.\",\n    \"10:31 am on 13 October, 2023: Caroline asked Melanie if she has any experience with adoption or knows anyone who has gone through the process on 13 October, 2023, 10:31 am.\",\n    \"10:31 am on 13 October, 2023: Melanie expressed that Caroline's friend's experience made her feel like she should consider adoption too on 13 October, 2023, 10:31 am.\",\n    \"10:31 am on 13 October, 2023: Caroline offered to help Melanie if she ever decides to adopt on 13 October, 2023, 10:31 am.\",\n    \"10:31 am on 13 October, 2023: Melanie asked Caroline if she has any tips for getting started on adoption on 13 October, 2023, 10:31 am.\",\n    \"3:31 pm on 23 August, 2023: Caroline applied to adoption agencies this week (originally stated as this week relative to 2023-08-23) as the first step towards becoming a mom; she feels excited but nerve-wracking about the decision and believes she is ready to give all her love to a child.

Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references unless instructed to keep them.\n\n    Memories for user Caroline:\n\n    [\n    \"10:37 am on 27 June, 2023: Caroline explained that the necklace is a gift from her grandma in Sweden and represents love, faith, and strength, reminding her of her family and roots.\",\n    \"10:37 am on 27 June, 2023: Caroline mentioned that the necklace she sent is special to her and was a gift from her grandma in Sweden when she was young.

{"data_source": "evaluation_metrics_20251220_132207_combined", "prompt": [{"content": "\n    You are an intelligent memory assistant tasked with retrieving accurate information from conversation memories.\n\n    # CONTEXT:\n    You have access to memories from two speakers in a conversation. These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references unless instructed to keep them.\n\n    Memories for user Caroline:\n\n    [\n    \"10:37 am on 27 June, 2023: Caroline mentioned that she has a hand-painted bowl with sentimental value, made by a friend for her 18th birthday ten years ago.

These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references unless instructed to keep them.\n\n    Memories for user Caroline:\n\n    [\n    \"1:51 pm on 15 July, 2023: Melanie's family had an awesome time camping, exploring nature, roasting marshmallows around the campfire, and going on a hike.

These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references unless instructed to keep them.\n\n    Memories for user Caroline:\n\n    [\n    \"10:37 am on 27 June, 2023: Caroline's motivation for pursuing counseling stems from her own journey and the support she received, which made a significant difference in her life.\",\n    \"10:37 am on 27 June, 2023: Caroline is pursuing counseling and mental health services focused on working with trans people to help them accept themselves and support their mental health.\",\n    \"4:33 pm on 12 July, 2023: Caroline is inspired to help others with their mental health because she struggled with mental health and received helpful support.\",\n    \"4:33 pm on 12 July, 2023: Caroline started looking into counseling and mental health career options to help others on their journeys, similar to how she was helped.\",\n    \"8:18 pm on 6 July, 2023: Caroline is interested in counseling or mental health work and finds it rewarding despite the challenges; she is passionate about helping people and making a positive impact.\",\n    \"4:33 pm on 12 July, 2023: Caroline is interested in jobs in counseling or mental health, as she wants to support people with similar issues.\",\n    \"10:37 am on 27 June, 2023: Caroline wants to help others through counseling and support groups, as she saw how they improved her life and helped her understand herself.\",\n    \"10:37 am on 27 June, 2023: Melanie asked Caroline about the specific kind of counseling and mental health services she wants to pursue\",\n    \"10:37 am on 27 June, 2023: Melanie expressed support for Caroline's career interest in counseling and mental health\",\n    \"1:56 pm on 8 May, 2023: Melanie praised Caroline for her empathy and understanding, suggesting she would be a great counselor.

{"data_source": "evaluation_metrics_20251220_132207_combined", "prompt": [{"content": "\n    You are an intelligent memory assistant tasked with retrieving accurate information from conversation memories.\n\n    # CONTEXT:\n    You have access to memories from two speakers in a conversation. These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references unless instructed to keep them.\n\n    Memories for user Caroline:\n\n    [\n    \"10:37 am on 27 June, 2023: Caroline attended an LGBTQ+ counseling workshop last Friday (time relative to a specific day: 'last Friday'), which was enlightening and discussed different therapeutic methods for working with trans individuals.\",\n    \"4:33 pm on 12 July, 2023: Caroline attended an LGBTQ conference two days ago (originally stated as two days ago relative to 2023-07-12, i.e., 2023-07-10) and found it to be a special and welcoming environment where she felt accepted.\",\n    \"1:56 pm on 8 May, 2023: Caroline attended an LGBTQ support group on 2023-05-07 (originally stated as yesterday relative to 2023-05-08).\",\n    \"10:37 am on 27 June, 2023: Caroline was inspired by the passion of the professionals at the workshop who aimed to create a safe space for people like her.\",\n    \"10:31 am on 13 October, 2023: Melanie asked Caroline about her recent artistic activities.\",\n    \"2:31 pm on 17 July, 2023: Caroline joined a mentorship program for LGBTQ youth last weekend (originally stated as last weekend relative to 2023-07-17, i.e., 2023-07-15).\",\n    \"1:36 pm on 3 July, 2023: Caroline is going to a transgender conference this month (vague time expression: 'this month')\",\n    \"3:19 pm on 28 August, 2023: Caroline volunteered at an LGBTQ+ youth center.

These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references unless instructed to keep them.\n\n    Memories for user Caroline:\n\n    [\n    \"1:51 pm on 15 July, 2023: Melanie mentioned that flowers were an important part of her wedding decor and always remind her of that day.

{"data_source": "evaluation_metrics_20251220_132207_combined", "prompt": [{"content": "\n    You are an intelligent memory assistant tasked with retrieving accurate information from conversation memories.\n\n    # CONTEXT:\n    You have access to memories from two speakers in a conversation. These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references unless instructed to keep them.\n\n    Memories for user Caroline:\n\n    [\n    \"1:51 pm on 15 July, 2023: Melanie mentioned that her kids are excited about summer break and that they are thinking about going camping next month.

{"data_source": "evaluation_metrics_20251220_132207_combined", "prompt": [{"content": "\n    You are an intelligent memory assistant tasked with retrieving accurate information from conversation memories.\n\n    # CONTEXT:\n    You have access to memories from two speakers in a conversation. These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references unless instructed to keep them.\n\n    Memories for user Caroline:\n\n    [\n    \"1:33 pm on 25 August, 2023: Caroline's artwork is a symbol of togetherness, celebrating differences and bringing people closer together.\",\n    \"12:09 am on 13 September, 2023: Caroline created a piece of art for a local church that represents how time changes our lives and shows her own journey as a transgender woman, emphasizing acceptance of growth and change.

{"data_source": "evaluation_metrics_20251220_132207_combined", "prompt": [{"content": "\n    You are an intelligent memory assistant tasked with retrieving accurate information from conversation memories.\n\n    # CONTEXT:\n    You have access to memories from two speakers in a conversation. These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references unless instructed to keep them.\n\n    Memories for user Caroline:\n\n    [\n    \"6:55 pm on 20 October, 2023: Melanie said the kids were scared but they were reassured and explained their brother would be OK, and that they're tough kids.\",\n    \"6:55 pm on 20 October, 2023: Caroline said the kids look cute and asked how they handled the accident.\",\n    \"7:55 pm on 9 June, 2023: Melanie said that her husband and kids keep her motivated.\",\n    \"1:36 pm on 3 July, 2023: Melanie tells Caroline to have fun and stay safe\",\n    \"1:14 pm on 25 May, 2023: Melanie said no doubts about Caroline's ability to provide love and stability to the kids.

These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references unless instructed to keep them.\n\n    Memories for user Caroline:\n\n    [\n    \"1:51 pm on 15 July, 2023: Melanie said her family has been awesome in helping her out and showing lots of love and support during her move.
