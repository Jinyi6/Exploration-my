{"data_source": "evaluation_metrics_20251226_004029_combined", "prompt": [{"content": "\n    You are an intelligent memory assistant tasked with retrieving accurate information from conversation memories.\n\n    # CONTEXT:\n    You have access to memories from two speakers in a conversation. These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories from both speakers\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps to determine the answer\n    3. If the question asks about a specific event or fact, look for direct evidence in the memories\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory\n    5. If there is a question about time references (like \"last year\", \"two months ago\", etc.), \n       calculate the actual date based on the memory timestamp. For example, if a memory from \n       4 May 2022 mentions \"went to India last year,\" then the trip occurred in 2021.\n    6. Always convert relative time references to specific dates, months, or years. For example, \n       convert \"last year\" to \"2022\" or \"two months ago\" to \"March 2023\" based on the memory \n       timestamp. Ignore the reference while answering the question.\n    7. Focus only on the content of the memories from both speakers. Do not confuse character \n       names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n    8. The answer should be less than 5-6 words.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question\n    4. If the answer requires calculation (e.g., converting relative time references), show your work\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked\n    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references\n\n    Memories for user Joanna:\n\n    [\n    \"5:54 pm on 9 November, 2022: Joanna praised Nate's idea of making gaming videos and encouraged him to connect with others who enjoy gaming.\",\n    \"11:15 am on 6 October, 2022: Nate said encouragement is what got him so far in his gaming career and that he figured why not share the love\",\n    \"10:57 am on 22 August, 2022: Nate is able to make a living through gaming, which has brought him success and is something he is passionate about.\",\n    \"7:31 pm on 21 January, 2022: Nate stated that his main hobbies are playing video games and watching movies.\",\n    \"7:44 pm on 21 April, 2022: Nate finds video games and fantasy/sci-fi movies great for escaping and expressing creativity.\",\n    \"3:56 pm on 4 November, 2022: Joanna said Nate's gaming activities sound like so much fun and that he's really passionate about gaming\",\n    \"8:10 pm on 7 November, 2022: Nate described his gaming setup as his own little haven to escape into the virtual world.\",\n    \"5:54 pm on 9 November, 2022: Nate shared that he is creating gaming content for YouTube as a cool way to entertain folks and satisfy his video game cravings when there aren't any tourneys going on; image: https://i.redd.it/i2l2lpmkj2mb1.jpg; title: a photo of a computer screen with a message on it.\",\n    \"10:58 am on 9 October, 2022: Nate made some friends at the convention who love games just like him and planned a gaming session together.\",\n    \"11:54 am on 2 May, 2022: Nate said gaming has been his focus recently, and he has been practicing a lot and even winning a few tournaments.\",\n    \"8:10 pm on 7 November, 2022: Joanna asks Nate what made him start playing 'Xeonoblade Chronicles' and notes that it is a Japanese game series.\",\n    \"8:10 pm on 7 November, 2022: Nate is a big fan of Nintendo games and wanted to play 'Xeonoblade Chronicles' because his friends recommended it.\",\n    \"11:54 am on 2 May, 2022: Joanna congratulated Nate and asked what game he was playing.\",\n    \"8:10 pm on 7 November, 2022: Nate upgraded some of his equipment at home and uses the computer for gaming, practice, and competing with friends.\",\n    \"7:31 pm on 21 January, 2022: Nate mentioned that he loves action and sci-fi movies, particularly for their effects.\",\n    \"7:31 pm on 21 January, 2022: Joanna and Nate both have similar interests in movies.\",\n    \"11:15 am on 6 October, 2022: Nate said he can now enjoy his movies and games without stress after winning the tournament\",\n    \"10:58 am on 9 October, 2022: Nate recently saw a movie called 'Inception' that blew his mind with all the twists and dream stuff.\",\n    \"10:55 am on 24 June, 2022: Joanna asked if Nate's friends liked the controller accessories.\",\n    \"10:58 am on 9 October, 2022: Nate has been playing a game called 'Cyberpunk 2077' nonstop, which has a great futuristic setting and gameplay.\",\n    \"8:10 pm on 7 November, 2022: Nate finds something important for his career, as it helps him beat his competition.\",\n    \"10:55 am on 24 June, 2022: Joanna congratulated Nate on the success of the gaming party.\",\n    \"10:55 am on 24 June, 2022: Nate mentioned that he has been doing great and that the gaming party was a great success.\",\n    \"8:10 pm on 7 November, 2022: Joanna asked if Nate uses the computer for gaming, and he confirmed that he does, using it for practice and competition.\",\n    \"8:10 pm on 7 November, 2022: Joanna expressed admiration for Nate's gaming setup at home, calling it really awesome and great.\",\n    \"2:34 pm on 10 July, 2022: Nate won his fourth video game tournament on Friday (originally stated as Friday relative to 2022-07-10, i.e., 2022-07-08).
