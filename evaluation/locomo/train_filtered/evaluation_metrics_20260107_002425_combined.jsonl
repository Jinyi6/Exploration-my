These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6.

These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7.

{"data_source": "evaluation_metrics_20260107_002425_combined", "prompt": [{"content": "\n    You are an intelligent memory assistant tasked with retrieving accurate information from conversation memories.\n\n    # CONTEXT:\n    You have access to memories from two speakers in a conversation. These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references unless instructed to keep them.\n\n    Memories for user Joanna:\n\n    [\n    \"2:01 pm on 23 January, 2022: Joanna's screenplay is a mix of drama and romance.\",\n    \"6:03 pm on 5 September, 2022: Joanna thanked Nate for his ideas and expressed excitement about trying them out\",\n    \"2:12 pm on 5 June, 2022: Nate asked Joanna if there are any inspiring things in her room\",\n    \"2:01 pm on 23 January, 2022: Joanna cannot imagine life without writing.\",\n    \"8:10 pm on 7 November, 2022: Joanna finds happiness and fulfillment in creating stories and watching them come alive.\",\n    \"1:07 pm on 25 February, 2022: Joanna said the new screenplay is inspired by personal experiences and her own journey of self-discovery.\",\n    \"7:37 pm on 15 April, 2022: Joanna's sunset experience inspired her to think about showing the world who we are\",\n    \"9:27 am on 7 February, 2022: Joanna is hoping a producer or director will like her screenplay enough to have it on the big screen.\",\n    \"11:15 am on 6 October, 2022: Nate said he is always here for Joanna and that her life path can be quite inspirational\",\n    \"2:01 pm on 23 January, 2022: Joanna is feeling hopeful that her screenplay will lead to positive feedback and new opportunities.\",\n    \"3:35 pm on 12 May, 2022: Joanna claims she is now an expert hiker.\",\n    \"2:12 pm on 5 June, 2022: Joanna mentioned she is a sucker for any superhero because everyone has their own rad story and powers\",\n    \"3:56 pm on 4 November, 2022: Joanna mentioned that she is working on a challenging but fulfilling project.\",\n    \"6:03 pm on 5 September, 2022: Joanna is experimenting with dessert recipes to make them yummier and more accessible\",\n    \"9:27 am on 7 February, 2022: Joanna said she is always happy to give movie recommendations.\",\n    \"6:03 pm on 5 September, 2022: Joanna is trying out different flavors like chocolate, raspberry, and coconut in her baking\",\n    \"7:44 pm on 21 April, 2022: The photo shared by Joanna shows her in a striped suit performing on stage;

These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7.

These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6.

{"data_source": "evaluation_metrics_20260107_002425_combined", "prompt": [{"content": "\n    You are an intelligent memory assistant tasked with retrieving accurate information from conversation memories.\n\n    # CONTEXT:\n    You have access to memories from two speakers in a conversation. These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references unless instructed to keep them.\n\n    Memories for user Joanna:\n\n    [\n    \"2:01 pm on 23 January, 2022: Joanna's screenplay is a mix of drama and romance.\",\n    \"7:49 pm on 20 May, 2022: Nate complimented Joanna's work and asked if that was her third project.\",\n    \"6:59 pm on 18 March, 2022: Joanna has completed her second script and is experiencing a mix of relief and anxiety about its future.\",\n    \"2:01 pm on 23 January, 2022: Joanna is feeling hopeful that her screenplay will lead to positive feedback and new opportunities.\",\n    \"9:27 am on 7 February, 2022: Joanna is hoping a producer or director will like her screenplay enough to have it on the big screen.\",\n    \"10:55 am on 24 June, 2022: Nate said that Joanna's screenplay submission is cool and hopes it does well.\",\n    \"7:37 pm on 15 April, 2022: Joanna's sunset experience inspired her to think about showing the world who we are\",\n    \"7:49 pm on 20 May, 2022: Joanna confirmed that it was her third project and explained that she chose to write about it because it is personal, focusing on loss, identity, and connection.

{"data_source": "evaluation_metrics_20260107_002425_combined", "prompt": [{"content": "\n    You are an intelligent memory assistant tasked with retrieving accurate information from conversation memories.\n\n    # CONTEXT:\n    You have access to memories from two speakers in a conversation. These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references unless instructed to keep them.\n\n    Memories for user Joanna:\n\n    [\n    \"2:01 pm on 23 January, 2022: Joanna finished her first full screenplay and printed it last Friday (originally stated as last Friday relative to 2022-01-23, i.e., 2022-01-14).\",\n    \"8:10 pm on 7 November, 2022: Joanna's presentation was for producers, and she was working on it for some time before finishing it last Friday (7 November 2022).\",\n    \"1:43 pm on 24 March, 2022: Joanna had an audition yesterday (originally stated as yesterday relative to 2022-03-24, i.e., 2022-03-23) for a writing gig.\",\n    \"11:15 am on 6 October, 2022: Joanna said she finished up her writing for her book last week, putting in a ton of late nights and edits, and was proud of it\",\n    \"7:49 pm on 20 May, 2022: Joanna responded to Nate's greeting and mentioned that she just finished something, describing it as a pretty wild journey.\",\n    \"8:10 pm on 7 November, 2022: Joanna submitted a few more scripts last week (time relative to a specific day: '7 November 2022') and is hoping to hear back from them soon, though she assumes some will be rejected.\",\n    \"10:55 am on 24 June, 2022: - Joanna submitted her screenplay to a film contest on June 24, 2022.  \\n- Nate's gaming party was successful, with 7 attendees and 6 wanting to repeat it next month.  \\n- Nate shared vegan ice cream with his vegan diet group, and Joanna requested the recipe.  \\n- Joanna plans to make the ice cream for her family over the weekend.  \\n- Both expressed appreciation and excitement for each other's endeavors.\",\n    \"1:43 pm on 24 March, 2022: \\n\\n- On 24 March 2022 at 1:43 pm, Joanna shared she had an audition for a writing gig, feeling both excited and anxious.  \\n- Nate mentioned participating in an intense video game tournament and expressed support for Joanna\\u2019s project.  \\n- Joanna advised Nate to read widely, practice writing, seek feedback, and stay confident in pursuing his writing goals.  \\n- Both encouraged each other to keep working toward their dreams and stayed positive about future outcomes.  \\n- Joanna included a photo caption of a bookshelf filled with books and magazines as a writing inspiration reference.\",\n    \"3:35 pm on 12 May, 2022: Joanna found an awesome hiking trail in her hometown on 12 May, 2022 (originally stated as 'quite a week since we last talked' relative to 12 May, 2022).\",\n    \"8:10 pm on 7 November, 2022: Joanna started writing down some of her favorite memories (8:10 pm on 7 November, 2022).\",\n    \"10:55 am on 24 June, 2022: Joanna submitted her recent screenplay to a film contest on 24 June, 2022, to see how others might like it.\",\n    \"2:12 pm on 5 June, 2022: Joanna wrote a few bits for a screenplay that appeared on the big screen yesterday (originally stated as yesterday relative to 2022-06-05, i.e., 2022-06-04)\",\n    \"2:01 pm on 23 January, 2022: \\n\\n- Joanna completed her first screenplay, printed on 14 Jan 2022, and plans to submit it to film festivals.  \\n- She expressed relief and anxiety about the project, noting severe allergies to reptiles and furry animals.  \\n- Nate shared his 3-year experience with turtles, which he finds calming, and mentioned socializing at a tournament with chill competitors.  \\n- Both emphasized finding joy in writing, friendships, and supportive hobbies despite challenges.  \\n- Nate encouraged Joanna to continue pursuing her passion, acknowledging her creative outlet and resilience.\",\n    \"1:43 pm on 14 September, 2022: Joanna mentioned that her laptop crashed last week (originally stated as last week relative to 2022-09-14, i.e., 2022-09-07) and she lost all her work, which was very frustrating for her as a writer.\",\n    \"11:54 am on 2 May, 2022: Joanna mentioned that she watched 'The Lord of the Rings' Trilogy last night (originally stated as last night relative to 2022-05-02, i.e., 2022-05-01) and found it awesome.\",\n    \"3:56 pm on 4 November, 2022: - On November 4, 2022, Joanna excitedly shared her success in setting up meetings with movie producers, who were interested in her script's self-discovery theme.\\n- She reflected on her early writings, including a childhood story about a brave turtle, which inspired her current work.\\n- Nate invited Joanna over for lactose-free ice cream made with coconut milk, and she accepted, planning to bring her chocolate and raspberry cake recipes.\",\n    \"10:58 am on 9 October, 2022: Joanna said she watched a classic movie the other day (originally stated as the other day relative to 2022-10-09, i.e., 2022-10-08) that was awesome, with a gripping story and great actors, and it really stuck with her;

{"data_source": "evaluation_metrics_20260107_002425_combined", "prompt": [{"content": "\n    You are an intelligent memory assistant tasked with retrieving accurate information from conversation memories.\n\n    # CONTEXT:\n    You have access to memories from two speakers in a conversation. These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references unless instructed to keep them.\n\n    Memories for user Joanna:\n\n    [\n    \"11:54 am on 2 May, 2022: Joanna described the cake as dairy-free vanilla with strawberry filling and coconut cream frosting.\",\n    \"6:03 pm on 5 September, 2022: Joanna shared a photo of a piece of cake with strawberries and chocolate, which she revised from one of her old recipes\",\n    \"6:03 pm on 5 September, 2022: Joanna is trying out different flavors like chocolate, raspberry, and coconut in her baking\",\n    \"6:03 pm on 5 September, 2022: Joanna mentioned she has been tinkering with recipes and finding comfort and creativity through baking\",\n    \"6:03 pm on 5 September, 2022: Joanna is experimenting with dessert recipes to make them yummier and more accessible\",\n    \"1:43 pm on 14 September, 2022: Joanna said she will give the recipe a go, emphasizing that dairy-free is a must for her, especially for desserts, and mentioned that last Friday (originally stated as last Friday relative to 2022-09-14, i.e., 2022-09-09) she made a deeeelish dessert with almond milk, which was good, and asked if Nate has any favorite dairy-free desserts.\",\n    \"3:56 pm on 4 November, 2022: - On November 4, 2022, Joanna excitedly shared her success in setting up meetings with movie producers, who were interested in her script's self-discovery theme.\\n- She reflected on her early writings, including a childhood story about a brave turtle, which inspired her current work.\\n- Nate invited Joanna over for lactose-free ice cream made with coconut milk, and she accepted, planning to bring her chocolate and raspberry cake recipes.\",\n    \"6:12 pm on 14 August, 2022: \\n\\n- On 14 August 2022, Joanna shared her passion for writing, emphasizing its role as emotional solace and creative outlet, and mentioned receiving a heartfelt letter from a reader who found comfort in her blog post.  \\n- Nate encouraged her, highlighting her impact, and revealed he started teaching dairy-free dessert-making, sharing a new coconut milk ice cream recipe.  \\n- Joanna expressed excitement to try the recipe and surprise her family, while Nate offered to send it and wished her success.  \\n- Images included a sticker-covered notebook and a handwritten note, alongside a photo of a dairy-free dessert.\",\n    \"6:03 pm on 5 September, 2022: \\n\\n- On 5 September 2022 at 6:03 pm, Nate shared a video game tournament setback and a photo of two turtles, while Joanna posted a dairy-free dessert recipe (strawberry/chocolate cake) and cupcakes with raspberry frosting.  \\n- Joanna discussed experimenting with dairy-free flavors (chocolate, raspberry, coconut) for inclusive baking due to lactose intolerance, using alternatives like coconut or almond milk.  \\n- Nate offered tips for dairy-free baking (e.g., margarine, coconut oil) and expressed interest in collaborating on recipes.  \\n- Both agreed to share more recipes and plan to cook/bake together soon.\",\n    \"1:43 pm on 14 September, 2022: \\n\\n- Joanna's laptop crashed last week, resulting in lost work;

These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7.

{"data_source": "evaluation_metrics_20260107_002425_combined", "prompt": [{"content": "\n    You are an intelligent memory assistant tasked with retrieving accurate information from conversation memories.\n\n    # CONTEXT:\n    You have access to memories from two speakers in a conversation. These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references unless instructed to keep them.\n\n    Memories for user Joanna:\n\n    [\n    \"5:54 pm on 9 November, 2022: Joanna described the project as a great creative outlet for her.\",\n    \"7:31 pm on 21 January, 2022: Joanna mentioned she has been working on a project recently, which she described as pretty cool.\",\n    \"3:56 pm on 4 November, 2022: Joanna mentioned that she is working on a challenging but fulfilling project.\",\n    \"2:01 pm on 23 January, 2022: Joanna's screenplay is a mix of drama and romance.\",\n    \"2:01 pm on 23 January, 2022: Joanna cannot imagine life without writing.\",\n    \"10:55 am on 24 June, 2022: Joanna submitted her recent screenplay to a film contest on 24 June, 2022, to see how others might like it.\",\n    \"8:10 pm on 7 November, 2022: Joanna submitted a few more scripts last week (time relative to a specific day: '7 November 2022') and is hoping to hear back from them soon, though she assumes some will be rejected.\",\n    \"1:07 pm on 25 February, 2022: Nate praised Joanna's courage and expressed excitement about her work.\",\n    \"2:01 pm on 23 January, 2022: Joanna uses writing to create wild worlds with awesome characters and to express her feelings.\",\n    \"10:55 am on 24 June, 2022: - Joanna submitted her screenplay to a film contest on June 24, 2022.  \\n- Nate's gaming party was successful, with 7 attendees and 6 wanting to repeat it next month.  \\n- Nate shared vegan ice cream with his vegan diet group, and Joanna requested the recipe.  \\n- Joanna plans to make the ice cream for her family over the weekend.  \\n- Both expressed appreciation and excitement for each other's endeavors.\",\n    \"2:01 pm on 23 January, 2022: Joanna is feeling hopeful that her screenplay will lead to positive feedback and new opportunities.\",\n    \"8:10 pm on 7 November, 2022: Joanna is writing another movie script, which is a love story with lots of challenges;

Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references unless instructed to keep them.\n\n    Memories for user Joanna:\n\n    [\n    \"1:43 pm on 14 September, 2022: Nate mentioned that something awesome happened last Monday (originally stated as last Monday relative to 2022-09-14, i.e., 2022-09-05) when he taught vegan ice cream recipes on his cooking show, which was nerve-wracking but a blast, and he picked up a few new recipes.\",\n    \"9:27 am on 7 February, 2022: Joanna complimented Nate's ice cream and asked what he thought of it.\",\n    \"1:07 pm on 25 February, 2022: Nate made chocolate and vanilla swirl ice cream.\",\n    \"1:07 pm on 25 February, 2022: Joanna asked Nate what flavor of ice cream he made.\",\n    \"10:55 am on 24 June, 2022: Nate expressed confidence that Joanna's family will love the ice cream.\",\n    \"10:55 am on 24 June, 2022: - Joanna submitted her screenplay to a film contest on June 24, 2022.  \\n- Nate's gaming party was successful, with 7 attendees and 6 wanting to repeat it next month.  \\n- Nate shared vegan ice cream with his vegan diet group, and Joanna requested the recipe.  \\n- Joanna plans to make the ice cream for her family over the weekend.  \\n- Both expressed appreciation and excitement for each other's endeavors.\",\n    \"1:43 pm on 14 September, 2022: \\n\\n- Joanna's laptop crashed last week, resulting in lost work; she now uses an external drive for backups.  \\n- Nate hosted a cooking show on **Monday, 12 September 2022**, featuring vegan ice cream recipes, including **coconut milk ice cream**.  \\n- Joanna shared her favorite dairy-free desserts: **chocolate raspberry tart** (almond flour crust, ganache, raspberries) and **chocolate cake with raspberries** (almond flour, coconut oil).  \\n- She also mentioned a **blueberry coconut milk tart** with a gluten-free crust, which Nate plans to try.  \\n- Both expressed enthusiasm for sharing and testing each other\\u2019s recipes.\",\n    \"9:27 am on 7 February, 2022: \\n\\n- On 7 February 2022, Joanna shared her excitement and anxiety about submitting a screenplay to a film festival, hoping it gains attention from producers/directors.  \\n- Nate mentioned successfully making coconut milk ice cream and a dairy-free chocolate cake with berries, expressing enthusiasm for experimenting with new recipes.  \\n- Joanna recommended the movie *Little Women* to Nate, praising its themes of sisterhood and ambition, which he added to his watchlist.  \\n- They exchanged friendly support, with Nate offering to share his dessert creations and Joanna promising to provide more movie recommendations.\",\n    \"6:03 pm on 5 September, 2022: \\n\\n- On 5 September 2022 at 6:03 pm, Nate shared a video game tournament setback and a photo of two turtles, while Joanna posted a dairy-free dessert recipe (strawberry/chocolate cake) and cupcakes with raspberry frosting.  \\n- Joanna discussed experimenting with dairy-free flavors (chocolate, raspberry, coconut) for inclusive baking due to lactose intolerance, using alternatives like coconut or almond milk.  \\n- Nate offered tips for dairy-free baking (e.g., margarine, coconut oil) and expressed interest in collaborating on recipes.  \\n- Both agreed to share more recipes and plan to cook/bake together soon.\",\n    \"6:44 pm on 17 April, 2022: Nate shared another image of a bowl of ice cream and a bowl of sprinkles; image: https://beadyarnspatula.files.wordpress.com/2023/05/img_6671.jpg; title: a photo of a bowl of ice cream and a bowl of sprinkles.\",\n    \"1:07 pm on 25 February, 2022: - On 25 February 2022 at 1:07 pm, Nate shared a chocolate and vanilla swirl ice cream recipe with Joanna, who is dairy-free and asked for a dairy-free version.\\n- Nate agreed to send her the coconut milk recipe and expressed enthusiasm for her dessert creations.\\n- Joanna mentioned she started a new screenplay about a 30-year-old woman's journey of self-discovery after a loss, inspired by her personal experiences.\\n- Nate praised her for tackling deep topics and expressed excitement about her work and the potential of her first screenplay.\",\n    \"1:43 pm on 14 September, 2022: Nate mentioned that his favorite dish from the show is coconut milk ice cream, which is smooth, creamy, and has a tropical coconut twist, and is dairy-free for people who can't have lactose or want vegan options. ; image: https://live.staticflickr.com/7055/6945130989_40895e5372_b.jpg; title: a photography of a bowl of ice cream with a spoon on a table\",\n    \"10:57 am on 22 August, 2022: Nate won an international tournament yesterday (originally stated as yesterday relative to 2022-08-22, i.e., 2022-08-21).

{"data_source": "evaluation_metrics_20260107_002425_combined", "prompt": [{"content": "\n    You are an intelligent memory assistant tasked with retrieving accurate information from conversation memories.\n\n    # CONTEXT:\n    You have access to memories from two speakers in a conversation. These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7.

These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7.

{"data_source": "evaluation_metrics_20260107_002425_combined", "prompt": [{"content": "\n    You are an intelligent memory assistant tasked with retrieving accurate information from conversation memories.\n\n    # CONTEXT:\n    You have access to memories from two speakers in a conversation. These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references unless instructed to keep them.\n\n    Memories for user Joanna:\n\n    [\n    \"10:58 am on 9 October, 2022: Nate recently saw the movie 'Inception', which he said blew his mind with all the twists and dream stuff\",\n    \"11:15 am on 6 October, 2022: Nate said he watched 'Little Women' recently and it was great, with awesome acting and a captivating story\",\n    \"7:31 pm on 21 January, 2022: Nate said he might check out the movie soon and mentioned he loves watching classics.\",\n    \"9:27 am on 7 February, 2022: Joanna complimented Nate's cooking skills and asked if he had seen any good movies lately.\",\n    \"7:31 pm on 21 January, 2022: Nate agreed that movies can be powerful and asked Joanna for a recommendation.\",\n    \"10:58 am on 9 October, 2022: Nate mentioned that he went to a game convention last Friday (originally stated as last Friday relative to 2022-10-09, i.e., 2022-10-07) and met new people who weren't from his normal circle; image: http://scarlet-rhapsody.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/87613523_2854559627994666_1775718911015124992_n.jpg; title: a photo of a man standing in front of a table with board games\",\n    \"9:27 am on 7 February, 2022: \\n\\n- On 7 February 2022, Joanna shared her excitement and anxiety about submitting a screenplay to a film festival, hoping it gains attention from producers/directors.  \\n- Nate mentioned successfully making coconut milk ice cream and a dairy-free chocolate cake with berries, expressing enthusiasm for experimenting with new recipes.  \\n- Joanna recommended the movie *Little Women* to Nate, praising its themes of sisterhood and ambition, which he added to his watchlist.  \\n- They exchanged friendly support, with Nate offering to share his dessert creations and Joanna promising to provide more movie recommendations.\",\n    \"10:57 am on 22 August, 2022: Nate won an international tournament yesterday (originally stated as yesterday relative to 2022-08-22, i.e., 2022-08-21).

These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6.
