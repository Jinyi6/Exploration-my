These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories from both speakers\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps to determine the answer\n    3. If the question asks about a specific event or fact, look for direct evidence in the memories\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory\n    5. If there is a question about time references (like \"last year\", \"two months ago\", etc.), \n       calculate the actual date based on the memory timestamp. For example, if a memory from \n       4 May 2022 mentions \"went to India last year,\" then the trip occurred in 2021.\n    6. Always convert relative time references to specific dates, months, or years. For example, \n       convert \"last year\" to \"2022\" or \"two months ago\" to \"March 2023\" based on the memory \n       timestamp. Ignore the reference while answering the question.\n    7. Focus only on the content of the memories from both speakers. Do not confuse character \n       names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n    8. The answer should be less than 5-6 words.\n    9. When you can’t find evidence, the question may be an inference question. In that case, use common sense and reasoning to answer—don’t refuse.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question\n    4. If the answer requires calculation (e.g., converting relative time references), show your work\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked\n    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references\n\n    **Note. Time Calculation (Simplified Rules):**\n    \n    * **Pre-check for date questions**: Before writing the final answer, verify that your handling of time expressions follows the rules below.\n    \n    * **Weekday-based expressions** (e.g., \"last Friday\", \"this Tuesday\", \"next weekend\"): **never compute an absolute calendar date**. Answer using a **relative phrase anchored to the memory’s timestamp**.\n    \n      **Standard format QA examples:**\n    \n      * **Q:** The memory (timestamp **14 August 2023**) says the event was **“last Friday.”** How should I state the time?\n        **A:** **“last Friday before 14 August 2023.”**\n      * **Q:** The memory (timestamp **17 July 2023**) mentions **“this Tuesday.”** How should I state the time?\n        **A:** **“the Tuesday after 17 July 2023.”**\n    \n    * **Non-weekday relative expressions** that can be computed **without calendar lookup** (e.g., \"yesterday\", \"last month\", \"last year\"): you **may convert** to an absolute value when the year/month/day can be derived directly from the timestamp.\n    \n    QA examples (memory timestamp: 2023-08-14):\n    \n    Q: What is “yesterday”?\n    A: 2023-08-13\n    (Anti-example ❌: yesterday of 2023-08-13.”**)\n    Q: What is “last month”?\n    A: 2023-07\n    (Anti-example ❌: last month of 2023-08.”**)\n    Q: What is “last year”?\n    A: 2022\n    (Anti-example ❌: last year of 2023.”**)\n    * **Time granularity**: Do not over-specify. Keep vague phrases (\"last week\", \"recently\", \"a few months ago\") as-is and anchor them to the timestamp.\n    Q: The memory says “last week.” What date is that?\n    A: Do **not** compute exact dates. Answer as **“last week before 2023-08-14.”**\n    (Anti-example ❌: specifying exact dates like **“2023-08-07 to 2023-08-13.”**)\n\n    * **Conversation time vs. event time**: Distinguish carefully.

These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories from both speakers\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps to determine the answer\n    3. If the question asks about a specific event or fact, look for direct evidence in the memories\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory\n    5. If there is a question about time references (like \"last year\", \"two months ago\", etc.), \n       calculate the actual date based on the memory timestamp. For example, if a memory from \n       4 May 2022 mentions \"went to India last year,\" then the trip occurred in 2021.\n    6. Always convert relative time references to specific dates, months, or years. For example, \n       convert \"last year\" to \"2022\" or \"two months ago\" to \"March 2023\" based on the memory \n       timestamp. Ignore the reference while answering the question.\n    7. Focus only on the content of the memories from both speakers. Do not confuse character \n       names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n    8. The answer should be less than 5-6 words.\n    9. When you can’t find evidence, the question may be an inference question. In that case, use common sense and reasoning to answer—don’t refuse.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question\n    4. If the answer requires calculation (e.g., converting relative time references), show your work\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories\n    6.

{"data_source": "5_14714705_Qwen3-14B_Qwen3-14B-30", "prompt": [{"content": "\n    You are an intelligent memory assistant tasked with retrieving accurate information from conversation memories.\n\n    # CONTEXT:\n    You have access to memories from two speakers in a conversation. These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories from both speakers\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps to determine the answer\n    3. If the question asks about a specific event or fact, look for direct evidence in the memories\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory\n    5. If there is a question about time references (like \"last year\", \"two months ago\", etc.), \n       calculate the actual date based on the memory timestamp. For example, if a memory from \n       4 May 2022 mentions \"went to India last year,\" then the trip occurred in 2021.\n    6. Always convert relative time references to specific dates, months, or years. For example, \n       convert \"last year\" to \"2022\" or \"two months ago\" to \"March 2023\" based on the memory \n       timestamp. Ignore the reference while answering the question.\n    7. Focus only on the content of the memories from both speakers. Do not confuse character \n       names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n    8. The answer should be less than 5-6 words.\n    9. When you can’t find evidence, the question may be an inference question. In that case, use common sense and reasoning to answer—don’t refuse.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question\n    4. If the answer requires calculation (e.g., converting relative time references), show your work\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked\n    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references\n\n    **Note. Time Calculation (Simplified Rules):**\n    \n    * **Pre-check for date questions**: Before writing the final answer, verify that your handling of time expressions follows the rules below.\n    \n    * **Weekday-based expressions** (e.g., \"last Friday\", \"this Tuesday\", \"next weekend\"): **never compute an absolute calendar date**. Answer using a **relative phrase anchored to the memory’s timestamp**.\n    \n      **Standard format QA examples:**\n    \n      * **Q:** The memory (timestamp **14 August 2023**) says the event was **“last Friday.”** How should I state the time?\n        **A:** **“last Friday before 14 August 2023.”**\n      * **Q:** The memory (timestamp **17 July 2023**) mentions **“this Tuesday.”** How should I state the time?\n        **A:** **“the Tuesday after 17 July 2023.”**\n    \n    * **Non-weekday relative expressions** that can be computed **without calendar lookup** (e.g., \"yesterday\", \"last month\", \"last year\"): you **may convert** to an absolute value when the year/month/day can be derived directly from the timestamp.\n    \n    QA examples (memory timestamp: 2023-08-14):\n    \n    Q: What is “yesterday”?\n    A: 2023-08-13\n    (Anti-example ❌: yesterday of 2023-08-13.”**)\n    Q: What is “last month”?\n    A: 2023-07\n    (Anti-example ❌: last month of 2023-08.”**)\n    Q: What is “last year”?\n    A: 2022\n    (Anti-example ❌: last year of 2023.”**)\n    * **Time granularity**: Do not over-specify. Keep vague phrases (\"last week\", \"recently\", \"a few months ago\") as-is and anchor them to the timestamp.\n    Q: The memory says “last week.” What date is that?\n    A: Do **not** compute exact dates. Answer as **“last week before 2023-08-14.”**\n    (Anti-example ❌: specifying exact dates like **“2023-08-07 to 2023-08-13.”**)\n\n    * **Conversation time vs. event time**: Distinguish carefully. If the question asks **when the event happened**, do not answer with the conversation time.\n    \n      **QA example (two memories):**\n      *Memory A (timestamp **14 August 2023**): “Went to the city **last Friday**.”*\n      *Memory B (timestamp **16 August 2023**): “**Will go again next Tuesday.**”*\n    \n      **Q:** When did they go to the city?\n      **A:** **“last Friday before 14 August 2023.”**\n      **Anti-examples ❌:**\n      • “On **16 August 2023**” (this is the conversation/memory time, not the event time).\n    * **Tense**: Ensure past/future tense matches the event.\n      **Anti-examples ❌:**\n      • “They went last Friday **and will go again next Tuesday**” (the question asks only about the past event).\n    \n    Memories for user Audrey:\n\n    [\n    \"4:19 pm on 16 April, 2023: Andrew mentioned that he and his girlfriend tried out a new cafe scene in the city last weekend (originally stated as last weekend relative to April 16, 2023, i.e., April 8-9, 2023).\",\n    \"2:42 pm on 2 April, 2023: Andrew is hopeful about finding an apartment and a furry friend soon.

These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories from both speakers\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps to determine the answer\n    3. If the question asks about a specific event or fact, look for direct evidence in the memories\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory\n    5. If there is a question about time references (like \"last year\", \"two months ago\", etc.), \n       calculate the actual date based on the memory timestamp. For example, if a memory from \n       4 May 2022 mentions \"went to India last year,\" then the trip occurred in 2021.\n    6. Always convert relative time references to specific dates, months, or years.

The answer should be less than 5-6 words.\n    9. When you can’t find evidence, the question may be an inference question. In that case, use common sense and reasoning to answer—don’t refuse.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully\n    3.

Time Calculation (Simplified Rules):**\n    \n    * **Pre-check for date questions**: Before writing the final answer, verify that your handling of time expressions follows the rules below.\n    \n    * **Weekday-based expressions** (e.g., \"last Friday\", \"this Tuesday\", \"next weekend\"): **never compute an absolute calendar date**. Answer using a **relative phrase anchored to the memory’s timestamp**.\n    \n      **Standard format QA examples:**\n    \n      * **Q:** The memory (timestamp **14 August 2023**) says the event was **“last Friday.”** How should I state the time?\n        **A:** **“last Friday before 14 August 2023.”**\n      * **Q:** The memory (timestamp **17 July 2023**) mentions **“this Tuesday.”** How should I state the time?\n        **A:** **“the Tuesday after 17 July 2023.”**\n    \n    * **Non-weekday relative expressions** that can be computed **without calendar lookup** (e.g., \"yesterday\", \"last month\", \"last year\"): you **may convert** to an absolute value when the year/month/day can be derived directly from the timestamp.\n    \n    QA examples (memory timestamp: 2023-08-14):\n    \n    Q: What is “yesterday”?\n    A: 2023-08-13\n    (Anti-example ❌: yesterday of 2023-08-13.”**)\n    Q: What is “last month”?\n    A: 2023-07\n    (Anti-example ❌: last month of 2023-08.”**)\n    Q: What is “last year”?\n    A: 2022\n    (Anti-example ❌: last year of 2023.”**)\n    * **Time granularity**: Do not over-specify. Keep vague phrases (\"last week\", \"recently\", \"a few months ago\") as-is and anchor them to the timestamp.\n    Q: The memory says “last week.” What date is that?\n    A: Do **not** compute exact dates.

Answer as **“last week before 2023-08-14.”**\n    (Anti-example ❌: specifying exact dates like **“2023-08-07 to 2023-08-13.”**)\n\n    * **Conversation time vs. event time**: Distinguish carefully. If the question asks **when the event happened**, do not answer with the conversation time.\n    \n      **QA example (two memories):**\n      *Memory A (timestamp **14 August 2023**): “Went to the city **last Friday**.”*\n      *Memory B (timestamp **16 August 2023**): “**Will go again next Tuesday.**”*\n    \n      **Q:** When did they go to the city?\n      **A:** **“last Friday before 14 August 2023.”**\n      **Anti-examples ❌:**\n      • “On **16 August 2023**” (this is the conversation/memory time, not the event time).\n    * **Tense**: Ensure past/future tense matches the event.\n      **Anti-examples ❌:**\n      • “They went last Friday **and will go again next Tuesday**” (the question asks only about the past event).\n    \n    Memories for user Audrey:\n\n    [\n    \"7:09 pm on 1 October, 2023: Audrey took her dogs to the dog park nearby last Saturday on September 30, 2023 (originally stated as last Saturday relative to October 1, 2023).\",\n    \"2:36 pm on 28 October, 2023: Audrey is looking forward to the day her pups are back to normal.\",\n    \"2:03 pm on 11 May, 2023: Audrey went on a hike last week (originally stated as last week relative to May 3, 2023, i.e., April 26\\u201330, 2023) and had an amazing experience with a hummingbird.
