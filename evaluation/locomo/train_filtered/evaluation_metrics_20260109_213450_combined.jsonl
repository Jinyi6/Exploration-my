Pay special attention to the timestamps to determine the answer\n    3. If the question asks about a specific event or fact, look for direct evidence in the memories\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory\n    5. If there is a question about time references (like \"last year\", \"two months ago\", etc.), \n       calculate the actual date based on the memory timestamp. For example, if a memory from \n       4 May 2022 mentions \"went to India last year,\" then the trip occurred in 2021.\n    6. Always convert relative time references to specific dates, months, or years. For example, \n       convert \"last year\" to \"2022\" or \"two months ago\" to \"March 2023\" based on the memory \n       timestamp. Ignore the reference while answering the question.\n    7.

Pay special attention to the timestamps to determine the answer\n    3. If the question asks about a specific event or fact, look for direct evidence in the memories\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory\n    5. If there is a question about time references (like \"last year\", \"two months ago\", etc.), \n       calculate the actual date based on the memory timestamp. For example, if a memory from \n       4 May 2022 mentions \"went to India last year,\" then the trip occurred in 2021.\n    6.

If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory\n    5. If there is a question about time references (like \"last year\", \"two months ago\", etc.), \n       calculate the actual date based on the memory timestamp. For example, if a memory from \n       4 May 2022 mentions \"went to India last year,\" then the trip occurred in 2021.\n    6. Always convert relative time references to specific dates, months, or years. For example, \n       convert \"last year\" to \"2022\" or \"two months ago\" to \"March 2023\" based on the memory \n       timestamp. Ignore the reference while answering the question.\n    7. Focus only on the content of the memories from both speakers. Do not confuse character \n       names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n    8. The answer should be less than 5-6 words.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question\n    4. If the answer requires calculation (e.g., converting relative time references), show your work\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked\n    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references\n\n    Memories for user John:\n\n    [\n    \"3:18 pm on 4 May, 2023: Maria describes her dinner spread as including salads, sandwiches, and homemade desserts, with her favorite being the banana split sundae, which she enjoys after a day of volunteering (Detected Keywords: John, Maria, Thanks, amazing, balance, banana, banana split sundae, day, day volunteering, desserts, enjoy, favorite, great, homemade, joy, key, life, little, lots, lots great, maria thanks john, moment, salads, sandwiches, split, sundae, things, things like salads, volunteering).\",\n    \"3:18 pm on 4 May, 2023: Maria shares that she and her mom made dinner together last night, and the image shows a table with a variety of food on it (Detected Keywords: 2b 2b142b420a54216cfc9432b6b35676b5, Image, John, Maria, caption, dinner, food, great, image https pinimg, kind, maria wow, mom, night, photo, photo table variety, support, support mom dinner, table, variety); image: https://i.pinimg.com/originals/2b/14/2b/2b142b420a54216cfc9432b6b35676b5.jpg; title: a photo of a table with a variety of food on it.\",\n    \"6:10 pm on 22 December, 2022: Maria said that shared meals build a strong bond and make life enjoyable and meaningful\",\n    \"6:10 pm on 22 December, 2022: Maria claims that getting together with loved ones for a good meal makes some awesome memories\",\n    \"6:10 pm on 22 December, 2022: John asked Maria if she had made anything lately\",\n    \"3:18 pm on 4 May, 2023: John thanks Maria for her support and asks about the dinner spread, noting that he made apple pie for the kids yesterday (Detected Keywords: Appreciate, Having, Image, John, Looks, Maria, Thanks, apple, apple pie, appreciate spread looks, banana, caption, caption photo person, cream, delicious, good, holding, ice, key, kids, maria having, person, photo, pie, plate, plate banana split, split, spread, sundae, support, yesterday); image: https://i.redd.it/tc1f75pa9df21.jpg; title: a photo of a person holding a plate with a banana split ice cream sundae.\",\n    \"6:10 pm on 22 December, 2022: Maria mentioned she made some peach cobbler recently, and it was great\",\n    \"3:34 pm on 17 July, 2023: Maria had a picnic last weekend (time relative to a specific day: 'last weekend') with some friends from church.

These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories from both speakers\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps to determine the answer\n    3. If the question asks about a specific event or fact, look for direct evidence in the memories\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory\n    5. If there is a question about time references (like \"last year\", \"two months ago\", etc.), \n       calculate the actual date based on the memory timestamp. For example, if a memory from \n       4 May 2022 mentions \"went to India last year,\" then the trip occurred in 2021.\n    6. Always convert relative time references to specific dates, months, or years. For example, \n       convert \"last year\" to \"2022\" or \"two months ago\" to \"March 2023\" based on the memory \n       timestamp. Ignore the reference while answering the question.\n    7.

Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question\n    4. If the answer requires calculation (e.g., converting relative time references), show your work\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories\n    6.

These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories from both speakers\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps to determine the answer\n    3. If the question asks about a specific event or fact, look for direct evidence in the memories\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory\n    5. If there is a question about time references (like \"last year\", \"two months ago\", etc.), \n       calculate the actual date based on the memory timestamp. For example, if a memory from \n       4 May 2022 mentions \"went to India last year,\" then the trip occurred in 2021.\n    6. Always convert relative time references to specific dates, months, or years. For example, \n       convert \"last year\" to \"2022\" or \"two months ago\" to \"March 2023\" based on the memory \n       timestamp. Ignore the reference while answering the question.\n    7. Focus only on the content of the memories from both speakers. Do not confuse character \n       names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n    8. The answer should be less than 5-6 words.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question\n    4. If the answer requires calculation (e.g., converting relative time references), show your work\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked\n    7.
