These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6.

Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing.

{"data_source": "evaluation_metrics_20251220_011436_combined", "prompt": [{"content": "\n    You are an intelligent memory assistant tasked with retrieving accurate information from conversation memories.\n\n    # CONTEXT:\n    You have access to memories from two speakers in a conversation. These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references unless instructed to keep them.\n\n    Memories for user Joanna:\n\n    [\n    \"7:44 pm on 21 April, 2022: Nate loves action and sci-fi movies because of the cool effects.\",\n    \"7:31 pm on 21 January, 2022: Nate mentioned he loves watching classics.\",\n    \"9:27 am on 7 February, 2022: Joanna asked Nate if he had seen any good movies lately (vague time expression: 'lately')\",\n    \"7:31 pm on 21 January, 2022: Nate said the movie sounds cool and asked if Joanna has seen it a lot\",\n    \"6:12 pm on 14 August, 2022: Nate asked if anything cool is happening recently.\",\n    \"11:15 am on 6 October, 2022: Nate said he recently watched 'Little Women' and enjoyed it, noting the acting was awesome and the story was captivating.\",\n    \"11:54 am on 2 May, 2022: Joanna watched 'The Lord of the Rings' Trilogy last night (originally stated as last night relative to 2022-05-02, i.e., 2022-05-01) after receiving a recommendation from Nate\",\n    \"2:01 pm on 21 October, 2022: Nate said: 'No problem!

{"data_source": "evaluation_metrics_20251220_011436_combined", "prompt": [{"content": "\n    You are an intelligent memory assistant tasked with retrieving accurate information from conversation memories.\n\n    # CONTEXT:\n    You have access to memories from two speakers in a conversation. These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references unless instructed to keep them.\n\n    Memories for user Joanna:\n\n    [\n    \"3:56 pm on 4 November, 2022: Joanna offered to come over tomorrow to visit Nate.\",\n    \"10:57 am on 22 August, 2022: Nate asked Joanna how she has been.\",\n    \"7:31 pm on 21 January, 2022: Joanna and Nate have similar interests.\",\n    \"2:34 pm on 10 July, 2022: Nate asked Joanna what the book is about.\",\n    \"8:10 pm on 7 November, 2022: Joanna asked what Nate's favorite game is\",\n    \"5:54 pm on 9 November, 2022: Nate said he would love to have Joanna over again and suggested they could watch one of her movies together or go to the park.\",\n    \"1:43 pm on 14 September, 2022: Nate said he will definitely try Joanna's dessert and thanked her.\",\n    \"3:56 pm on 4 November, 2022: Nate agreed to Joanna's visit and mentioned he had no plans for that day.\",\n    \"3:56 pm on 4 November, 2022: Nate said he would see Joanna then and asked her to take care.\",\n    \"5:54 pm on 9 November, 2022: Joanna said she would love to do either of those things with Nate.\",\n    \"10:58 am on 9 October, 2022: Nate said the living room Joanna described is very comfy and that he should get a setup like that.\",\n    \"8:10 pm on 7 November, 2022: Nate agrees to start writing down some of his favorite memories with Joanna from now on.\",\n    \"6:59 pm on 18 March, 2022: Nate said to Joanna: Just make sure you don't quit - the path forward will show up soon.
