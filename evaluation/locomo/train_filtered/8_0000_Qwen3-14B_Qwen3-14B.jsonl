{"data_source": "8_0000_Qwen3-14B_Qwen3-14B", "prompt": [{"content": "\n    You are an intelligent memory assistant tasked with retrieving accurate information from conversation memories.\n\n    # CONTEXT:\n    You have access to memories from two speakers in a conversation. These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories from both speakers\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps to determine the answer\n    3. If the question asks about a specific event or fact, look for direct evidence in the memories\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory\n    5. If there is a question about time references (like \"last year\", \"two months ago\", etc.), \n       calculate the actual date based on the memory timestamp. For example, if a memory from \n       4 May 2022 mentions \"went to India last year,\" then the trip occurred in 2021.\n    6. Always convert relative time references to specific dates, months, or years. For example, \n       convert \"last year\" to \"2022\" or \"two months ago\" to \"March 2023\" based on the memory \n       timestamp. Ignore the reference while answering the question.\n    7. Focus only on the content of the memories from both speakers. Do not confuse character \n       names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n    8. The answer should be less than 5-6 words.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question\n    4. If the answer requires calculation (e.g., converting relative time references), show your work\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked\n    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references\n\n    Memories for user Evan:\n\n    [\n    \"4:25 pm on 26 December, 2023: Evan feels a rush of joy from the painting with a bird flying over it\",\n    \"4:25 pm on 26 December, 2023: Evan painted the mentioned artwork with a sense of joy and freedom\",\n    \"6:48 pm on 17 December, 2023: Evan is proud of the painting\",\n    \"4:25 pm on 26 December, 2023: Evan finds art fascinating for its ability to express emotions\",\n    \"6:17 pm on 19 August, 2023: Evan is taking a painting class and is enjoying it\",\n    \"6:48 pm on 17 December, 2023: Evan finished the painting a few days ago\",\n    \"4:25 pm on 26 December, 2023: Evan believes art can portray feelings without words\",\n    \"1:47 pm on 18 May, 2023: Evan is passionate about watercolor painting\",\n    \"4:25 pm on 26 December, 2023: Evan believes art helps in recognizing and handling personal feelings\",\n    \"4:25 pm on 26 December, 2023: Evan appreciates Sam's compliment on the painting\",\n    \"1:47 pm on 18 May, 2023: Evan started watercolor painting a few years back\",\n    \"9:28 am on 11 September, 2023: Evan is excited about the painting activity with Sam\",\n    \"4:25 pm on 26 December, 2023: Evan finds the painting inspiring and acknowledges Sam's understanding of art\",\n    \"9:28 am on 11 September, 2023: Evan has a photo of a painting of a mountain range with a horse\",\n    \"6:17 pm on 19 August, 2023: Evan aims to convey the peacefulness of being outdoors in their paintings.\",\n    \"4:25 pm on 26 December, 2023: Evan shares that they created a painting with a white background and a blue, orange, and black design when they were feeling a mix of emotions -
