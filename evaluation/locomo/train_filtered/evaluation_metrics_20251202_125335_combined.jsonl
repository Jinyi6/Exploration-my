{"data_source": "evaluation_metrics_20251202_125335_combined", "prompt": [{"content": "\n    You are an intelligent memory assistant tasked with retrieving accurate information from conversation memories.\n\n    # CONTEXT:\n    You have access to memories from two speakers in a conversation. These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories from both speakers.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (原文指8月的一个月之前)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June/六月初”, “第一个周末”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (如逝者名单、车数、roadtrip 次数、共同点等).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories from both speakers. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references unless instructed to keep them.\n\n    Memories for user Caroline:\n\n    [\n    \"1:51 pm on 15 July, 2023: Melanie and her family enjoy hiking in the mountains and exploring forests to connect with nature and each other.\",\n    \"6:55 pm on 20 October, 2023: Melanie's kids were scared following an accident, but she reassured them that their brother would be OK.\",\n    \"3:31 pm on 23 August, 2023: Melanie thinks horses are awesome.\",\n    \"10:31 am on 13 October, 2023: Melanie loves showing off true selves.\",\n    \"4:33 pm on 12 July, 2023: Melanie recently got new shoes intended for running;

For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (如逝者名单、车数、roadtrip 次数、共同点等).\n    6.

Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7.

{"data_source": "evaluation_metrics_20251202_125335_combined", "prompt": [{"content": "\n    You are an intelligent memory assistant tasked with retrieving accurate information from conversation memories.\n\n    # CONTEXT:\n    You have access to memories from two speakers in a conversation. These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories from both speakers.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (原文指8月的一个月之前)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June/六月初”, “第一个周末”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (如逝者名单、车数、roadtrip 次数、共同点等).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories from both speakers. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references unless instructed to keep them.\n\n    Memories for user Caroline:\n\n    [\n    \"10:37 am on 27 June, 2023: Caroline attended an LGBTQ+ counseling workshop on June 23, 2023 (originally stated as Last Friday relative to June 27, 2023), which she found enlightening as they discussed therapeutic methods and how to best work with trans people.\",\n    \"1:33 pm on 25 August, 2023: Drawing flowers is one of Caroline's favorites.\",\n    \"10:31 am on 13 October, 2023: Caroline just contacted her mentor for adoption advice (vague time expression: 'just').\",\n    \"3:31 pm on 23 August, 2023: Caroline has always loved horses.\",\n    \"4:33 pm on 12 July, 2023: Caroline considers mental health a priority.\",\n    \"10:37 am on 27 June, 2023: Caroline found it amazing to see professionals at the LGBTQ+ counseling workshop (June 23, 2023) passionate about making a safe space for people like her.\",\n    \"1:36 pm on 3 July, 2023: Caroline plans to go to a transgender conference in July 2023 to meet other people in the community and learn more about advocacy (originally stated as this month relative to July 2023).\",\n    \"2:31 pm on 17 July, 2023: Caroline and her mentee attended an LGBT pride event in June 2023 (originally stated as last month relative to July 17, 2023, i.e., June 2023).

{"data_source": "evaluation_metrics_20251202_125335_combined", "prompt": [{"content": "\n    You are an intelligent memory assistant tasked with retrieving accurate information from conversation memories.\n\n    # CONTEXT:\n    You have access to memories from two speakers in a conversation. These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories from both speakers.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (原文指8月的一个月之前)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June/六月初”, “第一个周末”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (如逝者名单、车数、roadtrip 次数、共同点等).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories from both speakers. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references unless instructed to keep them.\n\n    Memories for user Caroline:\n\n    [\n    \"6:55 pm on 20 October, 2023: Melanie wants to be courageous for her family;
