If there is a question about time references (like \"last year\", \"two months ago\", etc.), \n       calculate the actual date based on the memory timestamp. For example, if a memory from \n       4 May 2022 mentions \"went to India last year,\" then the trip occurred in 2021.\n    6. Always convert relative time references to specific dates, months, or years. For example, \n       convert \"last year\" to \"2022\" or \"two months ago\" to \"March 2023\" based on the memory \n       timestamp. Ignore the reference while answering the question.\n    7. Focus only on the content of the memories from both speakers. Do not confuse character \n       names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n    8. The answer should be less than 5-6 words.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question\n    4. If the answer requires calculation (e.g., converting relative time references), show your work\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked\n    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references\n\n    Memories for user Deborah:\n\n    [\n    \"8:31 pm on 6 September, 2023: Jolene is excited to share this experience with her partner and learn new techniques\",\n    \"9:34 am on 24 August, 2023: Jolene said she has been studying, attending workshops, and networking to achieve her goals\",\n    \"4:50 pm on 25 February, 2023: Jolene's relationship started from a strong friendship.\",\n    \"8:31 pm on 6 September, 2023: Jolene said meditation helps her stay balanced during her studies\",\n    \"2:18 pm on 12 September, 2023: Jolene realized the importance of incorporating relaxation, self-care, and balance in life alongside her engineering studies.\",\n    \"8:31 pm on 6 September, 2023: Jolene said the project is tough but she's chugging along\",\n    \"9:34 am on 24 August, 2023: Jolene said she felt thrilled and rewarded to know her efforts were appreciated and is currently focusing on studying and gaining more experience, including thinking about more internships to enhance her skills\",\n    \"9:03 pm on 9 February, 2023: Jolene achieved more than she imagined during the retreat and experienced a real confidence boost\",\n    \"9:34 am on 24 August, 2023: Jolene mentioned that life has been hectic, but she is making strides toward her goals, which she described as being successful in her field and making a positive impact\",\n    \"9:03 pm on 9 February, 2023: Jolene has not yet reached out to any schools or centers but wants to solidify the plan first\",\n    \"9:03 pm on 9 February, 2023: Jolene accomplished something with her engineering project during the retreat, coming up with some neat solutions and is excited about it\",\n    \"7:39 pm on 8 September, 2023: Deborah expressed interest in learning more about Jolene's strategies.\",\n    \"4:06 pm on 23 January, 2023: Jolene said she is looking forward to the next chat\",\n    \"2:58 pm on 16 August, 2023: Jolene said she will definitely look into mindfulness and can't wait to get started.\",\n    \"9:34 am on 24 August, 2023: Jolene recently had the opportunity to present at a virtual conference and received positive feedback, which confirmed that she is on the right track\",\n    \"9:49 am on 27 January, 2023: Jolene said she learned to play video games on her own as a child.\",\n    \"4:50 pm on 25 February, 2023: Jolene and her partner met in an engineering class in college and quickly became friends.

These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories from both speakers\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps to determine the answer\n    3. If the question asks about a specific event or fact, look for direct evidence in the memories\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory\n    5. If there is a question about time references (like \"last year\", \"two months ago\", etc.), \n       calculate the actual date based on the memory timestamp. For example, if a memory from \n       4 May 2022 mentions \"went to India last year,\" then the trip occurred in 2021.\n    6. Always convert relative time references to specific dates, months, or years. For example, \n       convert \"last year\" to \"2022\" or \"two months ago\" to \"March 2023\" based on the memory \n       timestamp. Ignore the reference while answering the question.\n    7. Focus only on the content of the memories from both speakers. Do not confuse character \n       names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n    8. The answer should be less than 5-6 words.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question\n    4. If the answer requires calculation (e.g., converting relative time references), show your work\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked\n    7.
