These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1.

These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6.

These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7.

{"data_source": "evaluation_metrics_20260109_160146_combined", "prompt": [{"content": "\n    You are an intelligent memory assistant tasked with retrieving accurate information from conversation memories.\n\n    # CONTEXT:\n    You have access to memories from two speakers in a conversation. These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references unless instructed to keep them.\n\n    Memories for user Caroline:\n\n    [\n    \"7:55 pm on 9 June, 2023: Caroline talked about her transgender journey and encouraged students to get involved in the LGBTQ community during a school event last week (time relative to a specific day: 'last week')\",\n    \"4:33 pm on 12 July, 2023: Caroline is attending a transgender conference two days ago (originally stated as two days ago relative to 2023-07-12, i.e., 2023-07-10) and found it to be a special and welcoming environment where she connected with people who have gone through similar journeys.\",\n    \"2:31 pm on 17 July, 2023: Caroline mentors a transgender teen similar to herself.\",\n    \"2:24 pm on 14 August, 2023: Caroline's art is about expressing her trans experience and helping people understand the trans community.\",\n    \"8:56 pm on 20 July, 2023: Caroline joined a new LGBTQ activist group last Tuesday (2023-07-11).\",\n    \"10:31 am on 13 October, 2023: Caroline attended a transgender poetry reading last Friday (originally stated as last Fri, i.e., 6 October, 2023).

Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references unless instructed to keep them.\n\n    Memories for user Caroline:\n\n    [\n    \"10:37 am on 27 June, 2023: Caroline mentioned that last Friday (originally stated as last Friday relative to 2023-06-27, i.e., 2023-06-23), she attended an LGBTQ+ counseling workshop, which was enlightening and discussed different therapeutic methods and how to best work with trans people\",\n    \"2:31 pm on 17 July, 2023: Caroline joined a mentorship program for LGBTQ youth last weekend (originally stated as last weekend relative to 2023-07-17, i.e., 2023-07-15).\",\n    \"10:37 am on 27 June, 2023: Caroline said she was inspired by the passion of the professionals at the workshop in making a safe space for people like her\",\n    \"1:36 pm on 3 July, 2023: Caroline is learning the piano as a creative outlet.\",\n    \"10:37 am on 27 June, 2023: Caroline mentioned that she has been looking into counseling and mental health as a career, aiming to help people who have gone through similar experiences as her\",\n    \"8:56 pm on 20 July, 2023: Caroline joined a new LGBTQ activist group last Tuesday (2023-07-11).\",\n    \"2:31 pm on 17 July, 2023: - Melanie and Caroline caught up on July 17, 2023, discussing their recent activities.\\n- Caroline shared her experience mentoring a transgender teen and attending an LGBT pride event in June.\\n- She is excited about an upcoming LGBTQ art show in August, featuring a painting inspired by a visit to an LGBTQ center.\\n- Melanie mentioned that she and her kids completed another painting similar to their previous one.\",\n    \"4:33 pm on 12 July, 2023: Caroline is attending a transgender conference two days ago (originally stated as two days ago relative to 2023-07-12, i.e., 2023-07-10) and found it to be a special and welcoming environment where she connected with people who have gone through similar journeys.\",\n    \"10:31 am on 13 October, 2023: Caroline contacted her mentor for adoption advice on 13 October, 2023; she is ready to be a mom and wants to provide a safe, loving home for kids who need it.\",\n    \"1:56 pm on 8 May, 2023: Caroline mentioned attending an LGBTQ support group yesterday (originally stated as yesterday relative to 2023-05-08, i.e., 2023-05-07) and found it powerful.\",\n    \"1:33 pm on 25 August, 2023: Caroline shared a recent self-portrait painting she made last week (originally stated as last week relative to 2023-08-23) with a blue face; image: https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0302/3968/6755/files/IMG_8385_a145b120-53ab-4b3c-8f1a-497fa2d39a49.jpg; title: a photo of a painting of a woman with a blue face.
