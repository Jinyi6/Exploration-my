These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references unless instructed to keep them.\n\n    Memories for user Jon:\n\n    [\n    \"4:04 pm on 20 January, 2023: Jon's group is working

These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references unless instructed to keep them.\n\n    Memories for user Jon:\n\n    [\n    \"2:32 pm on 29 January, 2023: Jon is considering the

{"data_source": "evaluation_metrics_20260106_215515_combined", "prompt": [{"content": "\n    You are an intelligent memory assistant tasked with retrieving accurate information from conversation memories.\n\n    # CONTEXT:\n    You have access to memories from two speakers in a conversation. These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references unless instructed to keep them.\n\n    Memories for user Jon:\n\n    [\n    \"1:26 pm on 3 April, 2023: Jon is hosting a dance

{"data_source": "evaluation_metrics_20260106_215515_combined", "prompt": [{"content": "\n    You are an intelligent memory assistant tasked with retrieving accurate information from conversation memories.\n\n    # CONTEXT:\n    You have access to memories from two speakers in a conversation. These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references unless instructed to keep them.\n\n    Memories for user Jon:\n\n    [\n    \"2:32 pm on 29 January, 2023: Gina mentioned that

{"data_source": "evaluation_metrics_20260106_215515_combined", "prompt": [{"content": "\n    You are an intelligent memory assistant tasked with retrieving accurate information from conversation memories.\n\n    # CONTEXT:\n    You have access to memories from two speakers in a conversation. These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references unless instructed to keep them.\n\n    Memories for user Jon:\n\n    [\n    \"1:26 pm on 3 April, 2023: Gina launched an ad

These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7.

These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references unless instructed to keep them.\n\n    Memories for user Jon:\n\n    [\n    \"1:26 pm on 3 April, 2023: Gina launched an ad

These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references unless instructed to keep them.\n\n    Memories for user Jon:\n\n    [\n    \"3:14 pm on 11 May, 2023: Gina had an interview for a design internship yesterday (originally stated as yesterday relative to 2023-05-11, i.e., 2023-05-10).\",\n    \"7:18 pm on 27 May, 2023: Gina got accepted for a fashion internship (originally stated as 'a lot's happened - I just got accepted for a fashion internship!')\",\n    \"7:18 pm on 27 May, 2023: Gina is excited and kinda nervous about the fashion internship (originally stated as 'I'm excited and kinda nervous.

{"data_source": "evaluation_metrics_20260106_215515_combined", "prompt": [{"content": "\n    You are an intelligent memory assistant tasked with retrieving accurate information from conversation memories.\n\n    # CONTEXT:\n    You have access to memories from two speakers in a conversation. These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references unless instructed to keep them.\n\n    Memories for user Jon:\n\n    [\n    \"9:38 pm on 16 June, 2023: Jon has been promoting his

These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6.

These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7.

{"data_source": "evaluation_metrics_20260106_215515_combined", "prompt": [{"content": "\n    You are an intelligent memory assistant tasked with retrieving accurate information from conversation memories.\n\n    # CONTEXT:\n    You have access to memories from two speakers in a conversation. These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references unless instructed to keep them.\n\n    Memories for user Jon:\n\n    [\n    \"3:14 pm on 11 May, 2023: Gina said that Jon's studio

{"data_source": "evaluation_metrics_20260106_215515_combined", "prompt": [{"content": "\n    You are an intelligent memory assistant tasked with retrieving accurate information from conversation memories.\n\n    # CONTEXT:\n    You have access to memories from two speakers in a conversation. These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references unless instructed to keep them.\n\n    Memories for user Jon:\n\n    [\n    \"3:14 pm on 11 May, 2023: Jon is working on opening
