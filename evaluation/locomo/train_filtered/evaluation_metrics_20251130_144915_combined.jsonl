For example, if a memory from \n       4 May 2022 mentions \"went to India last year,\" then the trip occurred in 2021.\n    6. Always convert relative time references to specific dates, months, or years. For example, \n       convert \"last year\" to \"2022\" or \"two months ago\" to \"March 2023\" based on the memory \n       timestamp. Ignore the reference while answering the question.\n    7. Focus only on the content of the memories from both speakers. Do not confuse character \n       names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n    8. The answer should be less than 5-6 words.\n    9. When you can’t find evidence, the question may be an inference question. In that case, use common sense and reasoning to answer—don’t refuse.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question\n    4. If the answer requires calculation (e.g., converting relative time references), show your work\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked\n    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references\n\n    **Note. Time Calculation (Simplified Rules):**\n    \n    * **Pre-check for date questions**: Before writing the final answer, verify that your handling of time expressions follows the rules below.\n    \n    * **Weekday-based expressions** (e.g., \"last Friday\", \"this Tuesday\", \"next weekend\"): **never compute an absolute calendar date**. Answer using a **relative phrase anchored to the memory’s timestamp**.\n    \n      **Standard format QA examples:**\n    \n      * **Q:** The memory (timestamp **14 August 2023**) says the event was **“last Friday.”** How should I state the time?\n        **A:** **“last Friday before 14 August 2023.”**\n      * **Q:** The memory (timestamp **17 July 2023**) mentions **“this Tuesday.”** How should I state the time?\n        **A:** **“the Tuesday after 17 July 2023.”**\n    \n    * **Non-weekday relative expressions** that can be computed **without calendar lookup** (e.g., \"yesterday\", \"last month\", \"last year\"): you **may convert** to an absolute value when the year/month/day can be derived directly from the timestamp.\n    \n    QA examples (memory timestamp: 2023-08-14):\n    \n    Q: What is “yesterday”?\n    A: 2023-08-13\n    (Anti-example ❌: yesterday of 2023-08-13.”**)\n    Q: What is “last month”?\n    A: 2023-07\n    (Anti-example ❌: last month of 2023-08.”**)\n    Q: What is “last year”?\n    A: 2022\n    (Anti-example ❌: last year of 2023.”**)\n    * **Time granularity**: Do not over-specify. Keep vague phrases (\"last week\", \"recently\", \"a few months ago\") as-is and anchor them to the timestamp.\n    Q: The memory says “last week.” What date is that?\n    A: Do **not** compute exact dates. Answer as **“last week before 2023-08-14.”**\n    (Anti-example ❌: specifying exact dates like **“2023-08-07 to 2023-08-13.”**)\n\n    * **Conversation time vs. event time**: Distinguish carefully. If the question asks **when the event happened**, do not answer with the conversation time.\n    \n      **QA example (two memories):**\n      *Memory A (timestamp **14 August 2023**): “Went to the city **last Friday**.”*\n      *Memory B (timestamp **16 August 2023**): “**Will go again next Tuesday.**”*\n    \n      **Q:** When did they go to the city?\n      **A:** **“last Friday before 14 August 2023.”**\n      **Anti-examples ❌:**\n      • “On **16 August 2023**” (this is the conversation/memory time, not the event time).\n    * **Tense**: Ensure past/future tense matches the event.\n      **Anti-examples ❌:**\n      • “They went last Friday **and will go again next Tuesday**” (the question asks only about the past event).\n    \n    Memories for user Tim:\n\n    [\n    \"4:21 pm on 16 July, 2023: John is excited about a game in Seattle next month (time relative to a specific day: '16 July, 2023')\",\n    \"7:54 pm on 17 August, 2023: John met back up with his teammates on 15 August 2023 (originally stated as the 15th) after his trip and felt a warm welcome from them.\",\n    \"3:00 pm on 2 October, 2023: John's girlfriend and he had an amazing and emotional wedding ceremony last week (time relative to a specific day: '2 October, 2023')\",\n    \"3:35 pm on 26 December, 2023: John started doing seminars, helping people with their sports and marketing on 26 December, 2023 (originally stated as 'my week's been busy' which is relative to the conversation date).\",\n    \"3:37 pm on 16 December, 2023: John said he injured himself not too long ago and had to miss some games and couldn't help his team.\",\n    \"2:52 pm on 31 August, 2023: Tim will share updates about the experience with John (31 August, 2023, 2:52 pm).\",\n    \"4:21 pm on 16 July, 2023: John is in talks with Gatorade about a potential sponsorship (as of 2023-07-16, 4:21 pm).\",\n    \"3:37 pm on 16 December, 2023: Tim said the injury is rough and asked if John has been able to stay active or keep up with his fitness routine while recovering.\",\n    \"2:52 pm on 31 August, 2023: John says goodbye and expresses hope to catch up soon (31 August, 2023, 2:52 pm).\",\n    \"3:36 pm on 11 November, 2023: John thanked Tim for his support and expressed his determination to keep pushing forward (3:36 pm on 11 November, 2023).\",\n    \"3:37 pm on 16 December, 2023: John had a milestone moment at the gym on last Friday (time relative to a specific day: '16 December, 2023', i.e., 12 December, 2023).

Pay special attention to the timestamps to determine the answer\n    3. If the question asks about a specific event or fact, look for direct evidence in the memories\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory\n    5. If there is a question about time references (like \"last year\", \"two months ago\", etc.), \n       calculate the actual date based on the memory timestamp. For example, if a memory from \n       4 May 2022 mentions \"went to India last year,\" then the trip occurred in 2021.\n    6. Always convert relative time references to specific dates, months, or years.

If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory\n    5. If there is a question about time references (like \"last year\", \"two months ago\", etc.), \n       calculate the actual date based on the memory timestamp. For example, if a memory from \n       4 May 2022 mentions \"went to India last year,\" then the trip occurred in 2021.\n    6.

These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories from both speakers\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps to determine the answer\n    3. If the question asks about a specific event or fact, look for direct evidence in the memories\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory\n    5. If there is a question about time references (like \"last year\", \"two months ago\", etc.), \n       calculate the actual date based on the memory timestamp. For example, if a memory from \n       4 May 2022 mentions \"went to India last year,\" then the trip occurred in 2021.\n    6. Always convert relative time references to specific dates, months, or years. For example, \n       convert \"last year\" to \"2022\" or \"two months ago\" to \"March 2023\" based on the memory \n       timestamp. Ignore the reference while answering the question.\n    7.

Pay special attention to the timestamps to determine the answer\n    3. If the question asks about a specific event or fact, look for direct evidence in the memories\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory\n    5. If there is a question about time references (like \"last year\", \"two months ago\", etc.), \n       calculate the actual date based on the memory timestamp. For example, if a memory from \n       4 May 2022 mentions \"went to India last year,\" then the trip occurred in 2021.\n    6. Always convert relative time references to specific dates, months, or years. For example, \n       convert \"last year\" to \"2022\" or \"two months ago\" to \"March 2023\" based on the memory \n       timestamp. Ignore the reference while answering the question.\n    7. Focus only on the content of the memories from both speakers. Do not confuse character \n       names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n    8. The answer should be less than 5-6 words.\n    9. When you can’t find evidence, the question may be an inference question. In that case, use common sense and reasoning to answer—don’t refuse.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question\n    4. If the answer requires calculation (e.g., converting relative time references), show your work\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked\n    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references\n\n    **Note. Time Calculation (Simplified Rules):**\n    \n    * **Pre-check for date questions**: Before writing the final answer, verify that your handling of time expressions follows the rules below.\n    \n    * **Weekday-based expressions** (e.g., \"last Friday\", \"this Tuesday\", \"next weekend\"): **never compute an absolute calendar date**. Answer using a **relative phrase anchored to the memory’s timestamp**.\n    \n      **Standard format QA examples:**\n    \n      * **Q:** The memory (timestamp **14 August 2023**) says the event was **“last Friday.”** How should I state the time?\n        **A:** **“last Friday before 14 August 2023.”**\n      * **Q:** The memory (timestamp **17 July 2023**) mentions **“this Tuesday.”** How should I state the time?\n        **A:** **“the Tuesday after 17 July 2023.”**\n    \n    * **Non-weekday relative expressions** that can be computed **without calendar lookup** (e.g., \"yesterday\", \"last month\", \"last year\"): you **may convert** to an absolute value when the year/month/day can be derived directly from the timestamp.\n    \n    QA examples (memory timestamp: 2023-08-14):\n    \n    Q: What is “yesterday”?\n    A: 2023-08-13\n    (Anti-example ❌: yesterday of 2023-08-13.”**)\n    Q: What is “last month”?\n    A: 2023-07\n    (Anti-example ❌: last month of 2023-08.”**)\n    Q: What is “last year”?\n    A: 2022\n    (Anti-example ❌: last year of 2023.”**)\n    * **Time granularity**: Do not over-specify. Keep vague phrases (\"last week\", \"recently\", \"a few months ago\") as-is and anchor them to the timestamp.\n    Q: The memory says “last week.” What date is that?\n    A: Do **not** compute exact dates. Answer as **“last week before 2023-08-14.”**\n    (Anti-example ❌: specifying exact dates like **“2023-08-07 to 2023-08-13.”**)\n\n    * **Conversation time vs. event time**: Distinguish carefully. If the question asks **when the event happened**, do not answer with the conversation time.\n    \n      **QA example (two memories):**\n      *Memory A (timestamp **14 August 2023**): “Went to the city **last Friday**.”*\n      *Memory B (timestamp **16 August 2023**): “**Will go again next Tuesday.**”*\n    \n      **Q:** When did they go to the city?\n      **A:** **“last Friday before 14 August 2023.”**\n      **Anti-examples ❌:**\n      • “On **16 August 2023**” (this is the conversation/memory time, not the event time).\n    * **Tense**: Ensure past/future tense matches the event.\n      **Anti-examples ❌:**\n      • “They went last Friday **and will go again next Tuesday**” (the question asks only about the past event).\n    \n    Memories for user Tim:\n\n    [\n    \"8:17 pm on 21 September, 2023: John asked Tim for book recommendations for his trip.\",\n    \"5:24 pm on 7 January, 2024: John asked Tim what book he is currently reading.\",\n    \"3:35 pm on 26 December, 2023: Tim found a book with tons of stories from travelers on 26 December, 2023.\",\n    \"9:52 am on 1 December, 2023: John offers to help Tim whenever they need it (mentioned on 2023-12-01).\",\n    \"3:35 pm on 26 December, 2023: Tim has been reading cool stories from travelers from around the world to plan his next adventure on 26 December, 2023.\",\n    \"9:52 am on 1 December, 2023: Tim complimented the image and asked John where they went camping.

These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories from both speakers\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps to determine the answer\n    3. If the question asks about a specific event or fact, look for direct evidence in the memories\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory\n    5. If there is a question about time references (like \"last year\", \"two months ago\", etc.), \n       calculate the actual date based on the memory timestamp. For example, if a memory from \n       4 May 2022 mentions \"went to India last year,\" then the trip occurred in 2021.\n    6. Always convert relative time references to specific dates, months, or years. For example, \n       convert \"last year\" to \"2022\" or \"two months ago\" to \"March 2023\" based on the memory \n       timestamp. Ignore the reference while answering the question.\n    7. Focus only on the content of the memories from both speakers. Do not confuse character \n       names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n    8. The answer should be less than 5-6 words.\n    9. When you can’t find evidence, the question may be an inference question. In that case, use common sense and reasoning to answer—don’t refuse.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully\n    3.

These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories from both speakers\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps to determine the answer\n    3. If the question asks about a specific event or fact, look for direct evidence in the memories\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory\n    5. If there is a question about time references (like \"last year\", \"two months ago\", etc.), \n       calculate the actual date based on the memory timestamp. For example, if a memory from \n       4 May 2022 mentions \"went to India last year,\" then the trip occurred in 2021.\n    6.
