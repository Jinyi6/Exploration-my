These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references unless instructed to keep them.\n\n    Memories for user Audrey:\n\n    [\n    \"1:10 pm on 27 March, 2023: Andrew started a new job as a Financial Analyst last week (time relative to a specific day: 'last week' from 2023-03-27).\",\n    \"4:22 pm on 13 October, 2023: Andrew mentioned a new spot that just opened the other day (originally stated as the other day relative to 2023-10-13, i.e., 2023-10-12).\",\n    \"7:49 pm on 6 September, 2023: Audrey advised Andrew to take care of himself and find ways to manage stress (originally stated as 6 September, 2023, 7:49 pm).\",\n    \"7:49 pm on 6 September, 2023: Andrew said finding balance has been challenging (originally stated as 6 September, 2023, 7:49 pm).\",\n    \"4:18 pm on 4 October, 2023: Andrew said, 'Oh you've helped so much.'\",\n    \"7:49 pm on 6 September, 2023: Audrey expressed sympathy for Andrew's tough work situation and mentioned that finding balance can be challenging (originally stated as 6 September, 2023, 7:49 pm).\",\n    \"9:19 pm on 19 August, 2023: Andrew took a break from work on 2023-08-18 (originally stated as yesterday relative to 2023-08-19) and checked out a new cafe; image: https://res.cloudinary.com/dragonspell/images/w_480,h_480,c_scale,dpr_auto,fl_progressive:steep,f_auto/w_480,h_480,c_fill/v1571420634/www.travelportland.com/Vista-House-Columbia-River-Gorge-Photo-by-Travel-Oregon-aspect-ratio-1x1/Vista-House-Columbia-River-Gorge-Photo-by-Travel-Oregon-aspect-ratio-1x1.jpg; title: a photo of a sunset over a mountain with a church on top\",\n    \"10:05 am on 11 July, 2023: Audrey responded positively to Toby and congratulated Andrew on his new addition\",\n    \"7:49 pm on 6 September, 2023: Andrew mentioned that work has been tough and stressful, causing him to reduce his outdoor activities (originally stated as 6 September, 2023, 7:49 pm).\",\n    \"9:48 am on 8 July, 2023: Andrew finds being in nature refreshing and joyful.\",\n    \"12:24 am on 24 August, 2023: Andrew said he would try to figure things out on his own first but is open to Audrey's help.\",\n    \"9:19 pm on 19 August, 2023: Andrew said 'See ya!' as a farewell.\",\n    \"2:03 pm on 11 May, 2023: Andrew said that's awesome and asked Audrey to keep him updated on their progress.\",\n    \"10:05 am on 11 July, 2023: Andrew said, 'Wow, those look great!

These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references unless instructed to keep them.\n\n    Memories for user Audrey:\n\n    [\n    \"4:19 pm on 16 April, 2023: Audrey shared an image of a muffin pan filled with blueberries and muffins; image: https://allisoncooksgoodeats.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/img_4467.jpg; title: a photo of a muffin pan filled with blueberries and muffins.\",\n    \"4:19 pm on 16 April, 2023: Audrey mentioned she made some of her favorite treats last week (time relative to a specific day: 'last week') and suggested having a pastry party sometime.\",\n    \"7:49 pm on 6 September, 2023: Andrew asked Audrey how she ensures she has enough time for herself (originally stated as 6 September, 2023, 7:49 pm).\",\n    \"10:05 am on 11 July, 2023: Audrey said, 'Thanks!

These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references unless instructed to keep them.\n\n    Memories for user Audrey:\n\n    [\n    \"2:42 pm on 2 April, 2023: Audrey told Andrew that they adopted another puppy named Pixie, who is very cute; image: https://moderndogmagazine.com/sites/default/files/images/photoentries/photos/pixie%20smiling.jpg; title: a photo of a small white dog sitting on a carpet\",\n    \"11:27 am on 2 June, 2023: Audrey took her pups to the park on 2023-06-01 (originally stated as yesterday relative to 2023-06-02), where they ran around and played without a leash, which filled her heart with joy and brought her peace.\",\n    \"2:42 pm on 2 April, 2023: Audrey said Pixie is fitting in great and that it took her a few days to adjust to the other dogs, but now they are awesome friends and enjoy playing and exploring the house; image: https://images.rawpixel.com/image_800/cHJpdmF0ZS9zdGF0aWMvaW1hZ2Uvd2Vic2l0ZS8yMDIyLTA0L2xyL3B4NzIxNzk3LWltYWdlLWt3dnYzenBkLmpwZw.jpg; title: a photography of a dog playing with a group of other dogs\",\n    \"2:36 pm on 28 October, 2023: Audrey made an appointment with an animal behaviorist on 2023-10-25 (normalized value: 2023-10-25).\",\n    \"2:36 pm on 28 October, 2023: Audrey responded that they're all mutts, with Pepper and Panda being Lab mixes, and Precious and Pixie being Chihuahua mixes.

These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references unless instructed to keep them.\n\n    Memories for user Audrey:\n\n    [\n    \"7:59 pm on 4 November, 2023: Audrey recently joined a dog owners group to learn how to better take care of her dogs (7:59 pm on 4 November, 2023).\",\n    \"11:05 am on 4 August, 2023: Audrey started agility classes with her pups at a dog park.\",\n    \"8:32 pm on 3 July, 2023: Audrey's dogs are doing better already due to the training course\",\n    \"2:03 pm on 11 May, 2023: Audrey is excited to learn how to train her dogs better\",\n    \"5:53 pm on 24 September, 2023: Audrey responded that she works on obedience and teaches them tricks like sit, stay, shake, and roll over, which are fun and rewarding for both her and the dogs.\",\n    \"9:19 pm on 19 August, 2023: Audrey learned dog grooming techniques by taking a dog grooming course and offered to share some tips.\",\n    \"8:32 pm on 3 July, 2023: Audrey is taking a dog training course and finds it challenging but rewarding; image: https://res.cloudinary.com/sagacity/image/upload/c_crop,h_2014,w_3017,x_0,y_0/c_limit,dpr_auto,f_auto,fl_lossy,q_80,w_1080/shutterstock_485806801_mv1xuv.jpg; title: a photo of two dogs running in a field with a ball in their mouth\",\n    \"2:03 pm on 11 May, 2023: Audrey's week has been focused on taking care of her four doggies and ensuring they are happy and healthy\",\n    \"12:24 am on 24 August, 2023: Audrey said it is super rewarding to take care of her dogs.\",\n    \"5:41 pm on 3 May, 2023: Audrey takes care of her dogs and got them something special for safety, which makes them look funny but works effectively; image: https://d4yxl4pe8dqlj.cloudfront.net/images/061f1763-db03-4b77-a9c7-85a24844f99e/21929851-1c63-40ee-b7bd-d977fdb693be_full_size.jpg; title: a photo of a dog with a leash and shoes on\",\n    \"2:36 pm on 28 October, 2023: Audrey said taking care of her dogs is a big deal and makes her really happy, which she takes seriously despite it being tough.\",\n    \"9:48 am on 8 July, 2023: Audrey suggests joining Andrew for a hike and bringing her dogs so they can run freely.\",\n    \"7:59 pm on 4 November, 2023: Andrew acknowledges Audrey's advice and intends to keep it in mind to balance Toby's growth and activity levels.

{"data_source": "evaluation_metrics_20251221_052929_combined", "prompt": [{"content": "\n    You are an intelligent memory assistant tasked with retrieving accurate information from conversation memories.\n\n    # CONTEXT:\n    You have access to memories from two speakers in a conversation. These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references unless instructed to keep them.\n\n    Memories for user Audrey:\n\n    [\n    \"2:36 pm on 28 October, 2023: Audrey's pups are responding well to positive reinforcement training, though progress is not immediate; Audrey is hopeful it continues.\",\n    \"5:53 pm on 24 September, 2023: Audrey believes it is important for pets to learn how to behave using positive reinforcement rather than punishment.

These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references unless instructed to keep them.\n\n    Memories for user Audrey:\n\n    [\n    \"5:23 pm on 13 June, 2023: Andrew had a rock climbing class last Sunday (originally stated as last Sunday relative to 2023-06-13, i.e., 2023-06-11) and reached the top; image: https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/0*h3ewAJq8YmXT5vb1.jpg; title: a photography of a man climbing on a rock face to face\",\n    \"5:23 pm on 13 June, 2023: Andrew shares images of nature, such as a mountain range with a sunset in the background.

These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references unless instructed to keep them.\n\n    Memories for user Audrey:\n\n    [\n    \"7:49 pm on 6 September, 2023: Audrey has a new place with a bigger backyard for her dogs.

These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references unless instructed to keep them.\n\n    Memories for user Audrey:\n\n    [\n    \"2:36 pm on 28 October, 2023: Audrey agreed to plan a hike and suggested picking a date.\",\n    \"6:12 pm on 19 October, 2023: Andrew and Audrey are planning a hike and looking for a nice place to go.\",\n    \"9:48 am on 8 July, 2023: Audrey said the hike was a 3-hour drive from her location.\",\n    \"6:12 pm on 19 October, 2023: Audrey is looking forward to a hike with the furry friends next month (originally stated as 'next month' on 2023-10-19).\",\n    \"10:05 am on 11 July, 2023: Andrew agrees to the hike and proposes doing it next month for more pleasant weather.

These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references unless instructed to keep them.\n\n    Memories for user Audrey:\n\n    [\n    \"7:59 pm on 4 November, 2023: Andrew agrees with Audrey but mentions that city living makes it hard for him to take his dogs for walks in the park.

{"data_source": "evaluation_metrics_20251221_052929_combined", "prompt": [{"content": "\n    You are an intelligent memory assistant tasked with retrieving accurate information from conversation memories.\n\n    # CONTEXT:\n    You have access to memories from two speakers in a conversation. These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references unless instructed to keep them.\n\n    Memories for user Audrey:\n\n    [\n    \"3:52 pm on 27 July, 2023: Andrew and his girlfriend volunteered at a pet shelter on Monday (2023-07-24), and found the experience rewarding and joyful.\",\n    \"10:14 am on 24 October, 2023: Andrew and his girlfriend attended a wine tasting last weekend (originally stated as last weekend relative to 2023-10-24, i.e., 2023-10-22).

{"data_source": "evaluation_metrics_20251221_052929_combined", "prompt": [{"content": "\n    You are an intelligent memory assistant tasked with retrieving accurate information from conversation memories.\n\n    # CONTEXT:\n    You have access to memories from two speakers in a conversation. These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references unless instructed to keep them.\n\n    Memories for user Audrey:\n\n    [\n    \"4:22 pm on 13 October, 2023: Audrey has a tattoo of her dogs and sunflowers on her arm; image: https://live.staticflickr.com/3674/10799791393_b3a685158c_b.jpg; title: a photography of a dog running with three other dogs in the background.

{"data_source": "evaluation_metrics_20251221_052929_combined", "prompt": [{"content": "\n    You are an intelligent memory assistant tasked with retrieving accurate information from conversation memories.\n\n    # CONTEXT:\n    You have access to memories from two speakers in a conversation. These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references unless instructed to keep them.\n\n    Memories for user Audrey:\n\n    [\n    \"8:32 pm on 3 July, 2023: Audrey loves cooking and her favorite recipe is Chicken Pot Pie.\",\n    \"10:14 am on 24 October, 2023: Audrey loves sushi and encourages others to try different types and flavors without limiting themselves to their comfort zone; image: https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5fb4299bc4391d58134367db/1607453049811-DZU05ZBSW3YPHU2G2TX2/Special+rolls+party+tray.jpg; title: a photo of a plate of sushi and vegetables on a table.\",\n    \"8:32 pm on 3 July, 2023: Audrey said that roasted chicken is one of her favorites and that she would send the recipe soon.\",\n    \"8:32 pm on 3 July, 2023: Audrey finds Chicken Pot Pie especially cozy and delicious on cold days.\",\n    \"8:32 pm on 3 July, 2023: Audrey said that garlic is her go-to ingredient because she loves the smell and taste it adds to dishes.\",\n    \"8:32 pm on 3 July, 2023: Andrew agreed that garlic is delicious and asked Audrey if she has a favorite dish she likes to make with it and if she would like to share the recipe.\",\n    \"10:14 am on 24 October, 2023: Audrey confirmed that she has tried sushi and loves it.

{"data_source": "evaluation_metrics_20251221_052929_combined", "prompt": [{"content": "\n    You are an intelligent memory assistant tasked with retrieving accurate information from conversation memories.\n\n    # CONTEXT:\n    You have access to memories from two speakers in a conversation. These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references unless instructed to keep them.\n\n    Memories for user Audrey:\n\n    [\n    \"10:14 am on 24 October, 2023: Audrey had an accident while playing with her pups at the park last week (time relative to a specific day: 'last week relative to 2023-10-24').

{"data_source": "evaluation_metrics_20251221_052929_combined", "prompt": [{"content": "\n    You are an intelligent memory assistant tasked with retrieving accurate information from conversation memories.\n\n    # CONTEXT:\n    You have access to memories from two speakers in a conversation. These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references unless instructed to keep them.\n\n    Memories for user Audrey:\n\n    [\n    \"7:49 pm on 6 September, 2023: Audrey's dogs enjoy playdates at the park where they meet other dog owners and make new friends.

{"data_source": "evaluation_metrics_20251221_052929_combined", "prompt": [{"content": "\n    You are an intelligent memory assistant tasked with retrieving accurate information from conversation memories.\n\n    # CONTEXT:\n    You have access to memories from two speakers in a conversation. These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references unless instructed to keep them.\n\n    Memories for user Audrey:\n\n    [\n    \"5:53 pm on 24 September, 2023: Audrey stated that the dogs are all mutts, with two being Jack Russell mixes and two being Chihuahua mixes, and agreed that some breeds do bond better than others.\",\n    \"1:10 pm on 27 March, 2023: Audrey has three dogs named Pepper, Precious, and Panda.\",\n    \"2:36 pm on 28 October, 2023: Audrey stated that the dogs are all mutts, with two being Jack Russell mixes and two being Chihuahua mixes.\",\n    \"2:36 pm on 28 October, 2023: Audrey responded that they're all mutts, with Pepper and Panda being Lab mixes, and Precious and Pixie being Chihuahua mixes.

{"data_source": "evaluation_metrics_20251221_052929_combined", "prompt": [{"content": "\n    You are an intelligent memory assistant tasked with retrieving accurate information from conversation memories.\n\n    # CONTEXT:\n    You have access to memories from two speakers in a conversation. These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references unless instructed to keep them.\n\n    Memories for user Audrey:\n\n    [\n    \"7:49 pm on 6 September, 2023: Andrew is still searching for a dog-friendly place to live (as of 6 September, 2023, 7:49 pm).\",\n    \"1:10 pm on 27 March, 2023: Andrew does not currently have any pets.\",\n    \"7:59 pm on 4 November, 2023: Andrew asked Audrey for tips on being a multi-dog pet owner (7:59 pm on 4 November, 2023).\",\n    \"1:10 pm on 27 March, 2023: Andrew does not have any pets at the moment (originally stated as 'No, no pets right now')\",\n    \"3:52 pm on 27 July, 2023: Andrew and his girlfriend volunteered at a pet shelter on Monday (2023-07-24), and found the experience rewarding and joyful.\",\n    \"9:02 am on 22 November, 2023: Andrew expressed gratitude for having Scout and mentioned that it's amazing to have so many furry friends.\",\n    \"1:10 pm on 27 March, 2023: Andrew mentioned that he loves animals even though he doesn't have any pets right now.\",\n    \"4:22 pm on 13 October, 2023: Andrew mentioned that last Tuesday, he, his girlfriend, and Toby had a really awesome night playing board games (originally stated as last Tuesday relative to 2023-10-13, i.e., 2023-10-10).\",\n    \"7:49 pm on 6 September, 2023: Audrey said she does at least one self-care activity each day, such as treating herself to something nice, and reminded Andrew to take care of himself and have fun (originally stated as 6 September, 2023, 7:49 pm).\",\n    \"9:02 am on 22 November, 2023: Andrew mentioned that he adopted another dog the other day (time relative to a specific day: 'the other day')\",\n    \"7:49 pm on 6 September, 2023: Andrew asked Audrey how she ensures she has enough time for herself (originally stated as 6 September, 2023, 7:49 pm).\",\n    \"1:10 pm on 27 March, 2023: Andrew's favorite animal is birds (originally stated as 'I've always been awed by birds')\",\n    \"10:05 am on 11 July, 2023: Andrew has a new puppy named Toby; image: https://i.redd.it/x7jn4meogw41.jpg; title: a photo of a dog sitting on a leash in a room\",\n    \"9:02 am on 22 November, 2023: Andrew said that they adopted another dog the other day and named it 'Scout' because of its adventurous spirit\",\n    \"6:12 pm on 19 October, 2023: Andrew said he never imagined having pets would bring so much happiness, and that pets bring lots of joy and companionship to our lives\",\n    \"9:58 pm on 16 August, 2023: Andrew said/claims that it must be great having furry friends to keep each other company\",\n    \"7:49 pm on 6 September, 2023: Audrey advised Andrew to take care of himself and find ways to manage stress (originally stated as 6 September, 2023, 7:49 pm).\",\n    \"7:49 pm on 6 September, 2023: Audrey said she organized a doggy playdate with the neighbors' dogs, and the dogs had fun (originally stated as 6 September, 2023, 7:49 pm).

{"data_source": "evaluation_metrics_20251221_052929_combined", "prompt": [{"content": "\n    You are an intelligent memory assistant tasked with retrieving accurate information from conversation memories.\n\n    # CONTEXT:\n    You have access to memories from two speakers in a conversation. These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references unless instructed to keep them.\n\n    Memories for user Audrey:\n\n    [\n    \"6:12 pm on 19 October, 2023: Audrey mentioned she had a good week recently, including visiting a pet store last Monday (originally stated as last Monday relative to 2023-10-19, i.e., 2023-10-16) to buy toys for her dogs; image: https://live.staticflickr.com/3923/14627245354_a40ab098c0_b.jpg; title: a photography of a box filled with toys and other items\",\n    \"10:05 am on 11 July, 2023: Audrey shared an image of personalized wooden keychains with engraved names for her dogs; image: https://thebaskshop.com/cdn/shop/files/image_8117b42d-0057-492c-9b06-88fc439af683.jpg; title: a photo of a group of wooden keychains with engraved names.

These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6.

These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references unless instructed to keep them.\n\n    Memories for user Audrey:\n\n    [\n    \"3:52 pm on 27 July, 2023: Andrew and his girlfriend volunteered at a pet shelter on Monday (2023-07-24), and found the experience rewarding and joyful.\",\n    \"7:59 pm on 4 November, 2023: Andrew asked Audrey for tips on being a multi-dog pet owner (7:59 pm on 4 November, 2023).\",\n    \"7:49 pm on 6 September, 2023: Andrew is still searching for a dog-friendly place to live (as of 6 September, 2023, 7:49 pm).\",\n    \"9:02 am on 22 November, 2023: Andrew mentioned that he adopted another dog the other day (time relative to a specific day: 'the other day')\",\n    \"10:47 am on 6 May, 2023: Andrew has been looking for a doggo to adopt by browsing websites, visiting shelters, and asking friends (originally stated as since last spoke, with no specific date given).; image: https://live.staticflickr.com/5006/5244715417_aa4e26e1d3_z.jpg; title: a photography of a dog looking through a cage at the camera\",\n    \"9:02 am on 22 November, 2023: Andrew said that they adopted another dog the other day and named it 'Scout' because of its adventurous spirit\",\n    \"6:12 pm on 19 October, 2023: Andrew adopted another pup from a shelter recently; image: https://i.redd.it/tousk84oar171.jpg; title: a photo of a dog sitting on a couch with a bowl of food\",\n    \"1:10 pm on 27 March, 2023: Andrew does not currently have any pets.\",\n    \"10:47 am on 6 May, 2023: Andrew finds the process of adopting a dog both fun and annoying.\",\n    \"1:10 pm on 27 March, 2023: Andrew does not have any pets at the moment (originally stated as 'No, no pets right now')\",\n    \"6:12 pm on 19 October, 2023: Andrew will be taking both of them to the trails together soon (originally stated as 'soon' on 2023-10-19).\",\n    \"4:22 pm on 13 October, 2023: Andrew mentioned a new spot that just opened the other day (originally stated as the other day relative to 2023-10-13, i.e., 2023-10-12).\",\n    \"4:22 pm on 13 October, 2023: Andrew mentioned that last Tuesday, he, his girlfriend, and Toby had a really awesome night playing board games (originally stated as last Tuesday relative to 2023-10-13, i.e., 2023-10-10).\",\n    \"10:14 am on 24 October, 2023: Andrew and his girlfriend attended a wine tasting last weekend (originally stated as last weekend relative to 2023-10-24, i.e., 2023-10-22).

{"data_source": "evaluation_metrics_20251221_052929_combined", "prompt": [{"content": "\n    You are an intelligent memory assistant tasked with retrieving accurate information from conversation memories.\n\n    # CONTEXT:\n    You have access to memories from two speakers in a conversation. These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references unless instructed to keep them.\n\n    Memories for user Audrey:\n\n    [\n    \"7:49 pm on 6 September, 2023: Audrey's dogs enjoy playdates at the park where they meet other dog owners and make new friends.

{"data_source": "evaluation_metrics_20251221_052929_combined", "prompt": [{"content": "\n    You are an intelligent memory assistant tasked with retrieving accurate information from conversation memories.\n\n    # CONTEXT:\n    You have access to memories from two speakers in a conversation. These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references unless instructed to keep them.\n\n    Memories for user Audrey:\n\n    [\n    \"5:53 pm on 24 September, 2023: Audrey believes it is important for pets to learn how to behave using positive reinforcement rather than punishment.

{"data_source": "evaluation_metrics_20251221_052929_combined", "prompt": [{"content": "\n    You are an intelligent memory assistant tasked with retrieving accurate information from conversation memories.\n\n    # CONTEXT:\n    You have access to memories from two speakers in a conversation. These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references unless instructed to keep them.\n\n    Memories for user Audrey:\n\n    [\n    \"1:51 pm on 26 June, 2023: Audrey recalled a hike a few years back where she and her friends discovered a stunning lake in the mountains\",\n    \"9:48 am on 8 July, 2023: Audrey shared a picture from a hike last year (originally stated as last year relative to 2023-07-08, i.e., 2022).\",\n    \"6:12 pm on 19 October, 2023: Audrey is looking forward to a hike with the furry friends next month (originally stated as 'next month' on 2023-10-19).\",\n    \"9:48 am on 8 July, 2023: Audrey had a great walk the other day (originally stated as the other day relative to 2023-07-08) and her furry friends make her happy.\",\n    \"6:12 pm on 19 October, 2023: Audrey expressed that the location sounds like a great getaway from the city and hopes to find something just as nice for their hike (originally stated on 2023-10-19).\",\n    \"7:09 pm on 1 October, 2023: Audrey mentioned that she and Toby are going on a hike with the dogs next month (time relative to a specific day: '1 October, 2023')\",\n    \"11:27 am on 2 June, 2023: Audrey went to a national park last week (time relative to a specific day: '2023-06-02') and reached a beautiful peak, which was stunning during the sunset.

{"data_source": "evaluation_metrics_20251221_052929_combined", "prompt": [{"content": "\n    You are an intelligent memory assistant tasked with retrieving accurate information from conversation memories.\n\n    # CONTEXT:\n    You have access to memories from two speakers in a conversation. These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references unless instructed to keep them.\n\n    Memories for user Audrey:\n\n    [\n    \"3:52 pm on 27 July, 2023: Audrey shared that she had many great memories with Max, including long walks in the neighborhood where they explored new paths.\",\n    \"3:52 pm on 27 July, 2023: Audrey identified the dog in the photo as Max, her childhood dog, who had lots of energy and loved fetch.\",\n    \"2:36 pm on 28 October, 2023: Audrey confirmed that she can't wait to make awesome memories with their furry friends\",\n    \"9:58 pm on 16 August, 2023: Andrew said/claims that he is glad Audrey had a blast with her pets and advised her to cherish those memories\",\n    \"3:52 pm on 27 July, 2023: Audrey said she grew very close to Max and shared her worries and hopes with him, who was a great listener.\",\n    \"2:42 pm on 2 April, 2023: Audrey hopes Andrew finds the perfect dog-friendly spot soon so he can make new memories with them\",\n    \"3:52 pm on 27 July, 2023: Andrew said that Audrey's pets sound amazing and that they must remind her of her childhood pup.\",\n    \"4:19 pm on 16 April, 2023: Audrey has a strong bond with her dogs and wants to see their happy faces even when they're not with her.\",\n    \"4:22 pm on 13 October, 2023: Audrey considers her dogs as her little family and finds them to be a source of love, companionship, and joy.\",\n    \"4:18 pm on 4 October, 2023: Audrey mentioned that she had a fun experience with her pups at the beach over the weekend, where they played in the ocean.\",\n    \"3:52 pm on 27 July, 2023: Audrey mentioned that Max would sniff and mark his territory during their walks.\",\n    \"3:52 pm on 27 July, 2023: Audrey's youngest pet is full of life and always up for an adventure.\",\n    \"7:49 pm on 6 September, 2023: Audrey responded that her dog absolutely loves the bed and curls up and snuggles like they're in a cloud.\",\n    \"11:05 am on 4 August, 2023: Audrey finds it amazing to watch her dogs learn and build relationships with other dogs.\",\n    \"1:10 pm on 27 March, 2023: Audrey has three dogs named Pepper, Precious, and Panda.\",\n    \"9:48 am on 8 July, 2023: Audrey finds the energy and happiness of dogs to be great and brings a smile to her face.\",\n    \"2:36 pm on 28 October, 2023: Audrey expressed excitement about capturing amazing moments with their furry friends\",\n    \"11:05 am on 4 August, 2023: Audrey described the experience as a great physical and mental workout for her dogs.\",\n    \"4:19 pm on 16 April, 2023: Audrey stated that her dogs bring so much joy to her life and she can't imagine life without them.\",\n    \"2:03 pm on 11 May, 2023: Audrey met a friendly and playful dog with the volunteer at the pet store\",\n    \"9:02 am on 22 November, 2023: Audrey reported that her dogs are doing great, exploring, and meeting new people, and that they feel loved and safe.\",\n    \"5:41 pm on 3 May, 2023: Audrey's dogs have tons of energy and get excited when she brings out items for playdates or activities\",\n    \"7:09 pm on 1 October, 2023: Audrey said that she and the pups are loving being out in nature and checking out new trails with the dogs, which is different from being in the city.\",\n    \"11:05 am on 4 August, 2023: Audrey feels warmth in her heart when seeing her dogs face and conquer challenges.\",\n    \"4:22 pm on 13 October, 2023: Audrey has a tattoo of her dogs and sunflowers on her arm; image: https://live.staticflickr.com/3674/10799791393_b3a685158c_b.jpg; title: a photography of a dog running with three other dogs in the background.

These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7.

These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references unless instructed to keep them.\n\n    Memories for user Audrey:\n\n    [\n    \"4:22 pm on 13 October, 2023: Audrey said her dogs love running around the park and socializing with other pups, but they hate snow and were confused when taken to a snowy dog park last winter (originally stated as last winter relative to 2023-10-13, i.e., 2022-12\\u20132023-02).\",\n    \"7:49 pm on 6 September, 2023: Audrey responded that her dog absolutely loves the bed and curls up and snuggles like they're in a cloud.\",\n    \"9:48 am on 8 July, 2023: Audrey responded that the dogs are all set for their next outdoor adventure.\",\n    \"4:22 pm on 13 October, 2023: Audrey responded that she thinks right now it's enough, unless she gets another dog.\",\n    \"2:36 pm on 28 October, 2023: Audrey responded to Andrew's image with admiration for the dog's happy face.\",\n    \"9:41 pm on 6 October, 2023: Andrew responded to Audrey's mention of missing nature and her dogs, expressing empathy and noting how dogs remind people to appreciate life's little pleasures.\",\n    \"5:53 pm on 24 September, 2023: Audrey responded that she works on obedience and teaches them tricks like sit, stay, shake, and roll over, which are fun and rewarding for both her and the dogs.\",\n    \"11:05 am on 4 August, 2023: Audrey described the experience as a great physical and mental workout for her dogs.\",\n    \"5:23 pm on 13 June, 2023: Audrey says being outdoors with her dogs puts her in her happy place, describing it as peaceful and inspiring.\",\n    \"12:24 am on 24 August, 2023: Audrey said her dogs make her really happy and she loves them so much that she wants to make them as happy as possible.\",\n    \"4:19 pm on 16 April, 2023: Audrey stated that her dogs bring so much joy to her life and she can't imagine life without them.\",\n    \"9:02 am on 22 November, 2023: Audrey stated that she is glad her dogs are part of her life and that they bring joy and friendship.\",\n    \"9:48 am on 8 July, 2023: Audrey expresses excitement about taking her dogs hiking and hopes they find a spot with a great view and room to explore.\",\n    \"1:51 pm on 26 June, 2023: Audrey states that she doesn't understand people who hate or hurt pets, considering them like family.\",\n    \"9:19 pm on 19 August, 2023: Audrey said to take care and have fun, and that her dogs will be waiting too.\",\n    \"9:02 am on 22 November, 2023: Audrey reported that her dogs are doing great, exploring, and meeting new people, and that they feel loved and safe.\",\n    \"5:23 pm on 13 June, 2023: Audrey mentions that her dogs love going on walks and it is their favorite part of the day; their faces brighten up as soon as she gets ready for a walk.\",\n    \"9:48 am on 8 July, 2023: Audrey finds the energy and happiness of dogs to be great and brings a smile to her face.\",\n    \"9:58 pm on 16 August, 2023: Audrey said/claims that the dogs are always there for each other and that seeing them together makes her so happy\",\n    \"4:22 pm on 13 October, 2023: Audrey mentioned that her dogs prefer nice, sunny days in the grass.\",\n    \"1:51 pm on 26 June, 2023: Audrey responded positively to Andrew's mention of the doggy daycare and expressed interest in taking her dogs there sometime soon.\",\n    \"12:24 am on 24 August, 2023: Audrey responded to the image by saying Toby looks happy and cute.\",\n    \"4:19 pm on 16 April, 2023: Audrey has a strong bond with her dogs and wants to see their happy faces even when they're not with her.\",\n    \"7:09 pm on 1 October, 2023: Audrey said that she and the pups are loving being out in nature and checking out new trails with the dogs, which is different from being in the city.\",\n    \"11:05 am on 4 August, 2023: Audrey feels warmth in her heart when seeing her dogs face and conquer challenges.\",\n    \"2:36 pm on 28 October, 2023: Audrey's pups are responding well to positive reinforcement training, though progress is not immediate; Audrey is hopeful it continues.\",\n    \"5:23 pm on 13 June, 2023: Audrey mentioned that the dogs' faces brighten up as soon as she gets ready for a walk.\",\n    \"5:23 pm on 13 June, 2023: Audrey mentioned that her dogs like the park and love meeting new people.

{"data_source": "evaluation_metrics_20251221_052929_combined", "prompt": [{"content": "\n    You are an intelligent memory assistant tasked with retrieving accurate information from conversation memories.\n\n    # CONTEXT:\n    You have access to memories from two speakers in a conversation. These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references unless instructed to keep them.\n\n    Memories for user Audrey:\n\n    [\n    \"6:12 pm on 19 October, 2023: Andrew and Buddy enjoy doing walks together as a way to spend time and get fresh air\",\n    \"5:23 pm on 13 June, 2023: Andrew said hiking with a dog is way fun and it's a great way to bond and create memories together.

These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references unless instructed to keep them.\n\n    Memories for user Audrey:\n\n    [\n    \"7:09 pm on 1 October, 2023: Andrew agreed to show Audrey the best bike routes near the river and mentioned it would be great to get outside and enjoy the scenery on 1 October, 2023, 7:09 pm.\",\n    \"7:09 pm on 1 October, 2023: Audrey thanked Andrew and asked him to show her the best bike routes by the river on 1 October, 2023, 7:09 pm.\",\n    \"7:49 pm on 6 September, 2023: Audrey advised Andrew to take care of himself and find ways to manage stress (originally stated as 6 September, 2023, 7:49 pm).\",\n    \"7:09 pm on 1 October, 2023: Andrew confirmed there are awesome bike routes near the river and offered to show Audrey the best ones on 1 October, 2023, 7:09 pm.\",\n    \"7:09 pm on 1 October, 2023: Audrey asked Andrew about good routes around the river on 1 October, 2023, 7:09 pm.\",\n    \"7:49 pm on 6 September, 2023: Audrey said she does at least one self-care activity each day, such as treating herself to something nice, and reminded Andrew to take care of himself and have fun (originally stated as 6 September, 2023, 7:49 pm).\",\n    \"7:09 pm on 1 October, 2023: Audrey took them to the dog park nearby last Saturday (originally stated as last Saturday relative to 2023-10-01, i.e., 2023-09-23).

{"data_source": "evaluation_metrics_20251221_052929_combined", "prompt": [{"content": "\n    You are an intelligent memory assistant tasked with retrieving accurate information from conversation memories.\n\n    # CONTEXT:\n    You have access to memories from two speakers in a conversation. These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references unless instructed to keep them.\n\n    Memories for user Audrey:\n\n    [\n    \"7:59 pm on 4 November, 2023: Audrey recently joined a dog owners group to learn how to better take care of her dogs (7:59 pm on 4 November, 2023).\",\n    \"7:59 pm on 4 November, 2023: Audrey tries to meet up with other dog owners once a week for tips and so the dogs can play together (7:59 pm on 4 November, 2023).\",\n    \"11:27 am on 2 June, 2023: Audrey took her pups to the park on 2023-06-01 (originally stated as yesterday relative to 2023-06-02), where they ran around and played without a leash, which filled her heart with joy and brought her peace.\",\n    \"7:59 pm on 4 November, 2023: Audrey loves checking out new parks with her four pups, and she had a fun weekend where her dogs were able to run around and get fresh air (7:59 pm on 4 November, 2023).; image: https://i.redd.it/hayawo8f86p51.jpg; title: a photo of a group of people and dogs in a park\",\n    \"7:59 pm on 4 November, 2023: Andrew asked Audrey for tips on being a multi-dog pet owner (7:59 pm on 4 November, 2023).\",\n    \"7:49 pm on 6 September, 2023: Audrey said she does at least one self-care activity each day, such as treating herself to something nice, and reminded Andrew to take care of himself and have fun (originally stated as 6 September, 2023, 7:49 pm).\",\n    \"5:41 pm on 3 May, 2023: Audrey takes care of her dogs and got them something special for safety, which makes them look funny but works effectively; image: https://d4yxl4pe8dqlj.cloudfront.net/images/061f1763-db03-4b77-a9c7-85a24844f99e/21929851-1c63-40ee-b7bd-d977fdb693be_full_size.jpg; title: a photo of a dog with a leash and shoes on\",\n    \"2:36 pm on 28 October, 2023: Audrey said taking care of her dogs is a big deal and makes her really happy, which she takes seriously despite it being tough.\",\n    \"7:09 pm on 1 October, 2023: Audrey took them to the dog park nearby last Saturday (originally stated as last Saturday relative to 2023-10-01, i.e., 2023-09-23).

These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references unless instructed to keep them.\n\n    Memories for user Audrey:\n\n    [\n    \"7:59 pm on 4 November, 2023: Audrey advises Andrew to ensure he has enough time and energy for Toby, emphasizing the need for attention and walks, particularly for a German Shepherd.
