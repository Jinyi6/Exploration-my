{"data_source": "evaluation_metrics_20251221_094611_combined", "prompt": [{"content": "\n    You are an intelligent memory assistant tasked with retrieving accurate information from conversation memories.\n\n    # CONTEXT:\n    You have access to memories from two speakers in a conversation. These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references unless instructed to keep them.\n\n    Memories for user James:\n\n    [\n    \"5:07 pm on 16 June, 2022: James said Max loves swimming and usually plays in the water at the beach or lake, and is a pro swimmer.

These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references unless instructed to keep them.\n\n    Memories for user James:\n\n    [\n    \"2:36 pm on 29 April, 2022: James asked John for suggestions on fantasy books.\",\n    \"5:07 pm on 16 June, 2022: John recommends the book series 'The Stormlight Archive', 'Kingkiller Chronicle', and 'The Expanse' as favorites.\",\n    \"2:36 pm on 29 April, 2022: James praised John's progress and encouraged him to keep going, adding that three days ago he bought an adventure book with fantasy novels and cool arts; image: https://i.redd.it/2xbwn05lpc761.jpg; title: a photo of a person holding a book open to a picture of a male character\",\n    \"2:36 pm on 29 April, 2022: John recommended 'The Name of the Wind' as a great novel with awesome writing.\",\n    \"8:56 pm on 20 September, 2022: James advised John to read the magazine, calling it a worthy source of information.\",\n    \"9:20 am on 3 October, 2022: James expressed excitement for Cyberpunk 2077, saying the world and story sound perfect.

{"data_source": "evaluation_metrics_20251221_094611_combined", "prompt": [{"content": "\n    You are an intelligent memory assistant tasked with retrieving accurate information from conversation memories.\n\n    # CONTEXT:\n    You have access to memories from two speakers in a conversation. These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references unless instructed to keep them.\n\n    Memories for user James:\n\n    [\n    \"1:45 pm on 6 August, 2022: John said that many people showed up for the CS:GO tournament and they made a bunch of money for charity.

These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references unless instructed to keep them.\n\n    Memories for user James:\n\n    [\n    \"4:30 pm on 13 June, 2022: John is starting his dream job next month (originally stated as 'I'm starting next month.')\",\n    \"8:56 pm on 20 September, 2022: John started a new startup - portable smokers on 2022-09-19 (yesterday relative to 2022-09-20, i.e., 2022-09-19); image: https://i.redd.it/2sop5yn1a8i81.jpg; title: a photo of a fire burning in a metal pot on a street\",\n    \"1:45 pm on 6 August, 2022: John's new job aligns with his values and passions\",\n    \"2:36 pm on 29 April, 2022: John is currently taking on freelance programming to hone his coding skills (as of 2022-04-29, 2:36 pm).\",\n    \"9:59 pm on 19 June, 2022: John is considering volunteer roles and potentially a career in the non-profit sector (Future plans: influenced by the experience).

These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references unless instructed to keep them.\n\n    Memories for user James:\n\n    [\n    \"9:32 pm on 20 April, 2022: James has also been to Turkey and Mexico.

These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references unless instructed to keep them.\n\n    Memories for user James:\n\n    [\n    \"4:30 pm on 13 June, 2022: James recently started a course that combines his passion for gaming and programming, which he finds fun and challenging and has increased his excitement for both (originally stated as 'By the way, I recently started a course that combines my passion for gaming and programming.

{"data_source": "evaluation_metrics_20251221_094611_combined", "prompt": [{"content": "\n    You are an intelligent memory assistant tasked with retrieving accurate information from conversation memories.\n\n    # CONTEXT:\n    You have access to memories from two speakers in a conversation. These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references unless instructed to keep them.\n\n    Memories for user James:\n\n    [\n    \"9:32 pm on 20 April, 2022: James is looking for a country to go to (mentioned in conversation at 9:32 pm on 20 April, 2022).\",\n    \"5:13 pm on 9 July, 2022: James said/claims that he bought air tickets to Toronto and is leaving the day after tomorrow evening (originally stated as the day after tomorrow evening relative to 2022-07-09, i.e., 2022-07-11 evening).\",\n    \"9:49 am on 22 July, 2022: James said that his trip went great and that he managed to visit another country, specifically Nuuk.\",\n    \"8:56 pm on 20 September, 2022: James streamed a game on 2022-09-20 (relative to 2022-09-20) and received nice comments from the gaming community, which made him feel stoked and inspired to keep going\",\n    \"9:49 am on 22 July, 2022: James is tired over the last two days and has to go; he says goodbye.

Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references unless instructed to keep them.\n\n    Memories for user James:\n\n    [\n    \"9:52 am on 12 April, 2022: James adopted a pup from a shelter in Stamford on 2022-04-05 (originally stated as last week relative to 2022-04-12, i.e., 2022-04-05); the pup is named Ned; image: https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0624/9512/9787/files/b7d0234c78c382f9d9fc42142115a987.jpg; title: a photo of a dog and a cat sitting on a dog bed\",\n    \"9:49 am on 22 July, 2022: James is tired over the last two days and has to go; he says goodbye.

These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references unless instructed to keep them.\n\n    Memories for user James:\n\n    [\n    \"9:59 pm on 19 June, 2022: John is considering volunteer roles and potentially a career in the non-profit sector (Future plans: influenced by the experience).

These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references unless instructed to keep them.\n\n    Memories for user James:\n\n    [\n    \"9:23 pm on 4 September, 2022: James asked Samantha to become his girlfriend on 2022-09-03 (originally stated as yesterday relative to 2022-09-04) and she agreed.\",\n    \"9:23 pm on 4 September, 2022: James and Samantha are going to a baseball game on 4 September, 2022, and James invited John to join.\",\n    \"9:16 am on 10 August, 2022: James met a girl named Samantha during the beach outing and is thinking of asking her out on a date.\",\n    \"9:23 pm on 4 September, 2022: James and Samantha were at the theater, where James proposed to Samantha.\",\n    \"12:37 am on 31 October, 2022: James said that he and Samantha have decided to move in together.\",\n    \"9:16 am on 10 August, 2022: James has Samantha's phone number and plans to call her tomorrow (originally stated as tomorrow relative to 2022-08-10, i.e., 2022-08-11).\",\n    \"9:23 pm on 4 September, 2022: James and Samantha have many things in common.\",\n    \"9:23 pm on 4 September, 2022: James and Samantha went to McGee's bar, where Samantha was found to love lager beer.\",\n    \"9:23 pm on 4 September, 2022: John asked James if he had anything new besides the great news about James and Samantha.\",\n    \"9:18 pm on 26 August, 2022: John agreed to meet James at McGee's Pub tomorrow (2022-08-27).\",\n    \"7:36 pm on 21 October, 2022: James mentioned that his mother came to see him with her army friend two days ago (originally stated as two days ago relative to 2022-10-21, i.e., 2022-10-19).\",\n    \"9:32 pm on 20 April, 2022: John greeted James and mentioned meeting three new friends in his programming course last Tuesday (originally stated as last Tuesday relative to 2022-04-20, i.e., 2022-04-12), who share the same passion as him and helped expand his social circle.\",\n    \"9:32 pm on 20 April, 2022: James said he got the idea for the game character from a walk with his dogs two weeks ago (time relative to a specific day: '2022-04-20'), during which a stranger who he had never seen nearby before amazed him with her eyes and appearance, leading him to feel like he fell in love at first sight.

{"data_source": "evaluation_metrics_20251221_094611_combined", "prompt": [{"content": "\n    You are an intelligent memory assistant tasked with retrieving accurate information from conversation memories.\n\n    # CONTEXT:\n    You have access to memories from two speakers in a conversation. These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references unless instructed to keep them.\n\n    Memories for user James:\n\n    [\n    \"9:18 pm on 26 August, 2022: James suggested going to Starbucks for coffee.\",\n    \"9:18 pm on 26 August, 2022: John proposed having a beer instead of coffee.\",\n    \"9:23 pm on 4 September, 2022: John said, 'That's why we are friends, to support each other!

{"data_source": "evaluation_metrics_20251221_094611_combined", "prompt": [{"content": "\n    You are an intelligent memory assistant tasked with retrieving accurate information from conversation memories.\n\n    # CONTEXT:\n    You have access to memories from two speakers in a conversation. These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references unless instructed to keep them.\n\n    Memories for user James:\n\n    [\n    \"9:18 pm on 26 August, 2022: James clarified that McGee's pub also serves light beers.\",\n    \"9:18 pm on 26 August, 2022: James suggested going to McGee's pub because it serves a great stout.\",\n    \"9:23 pm on 4 September, 2022: James and Samantha went to McGee's bar, where Samantha was found to love lager beer.\",\n    \"12:37 am on 31 October, 2022: James confirmed that they love McGee's bar and stated that one of the criteria for choosing their apartment was the presence of this particular bar nearby.\",\n    \"12:37 am on 31 October, 2022: John asked James if he loves spending time together in McGee's bar.\",\n    \"12:37 am on 31 October, 2022: James explained that they rented an apartment not far from McGee's bar.\",\n    \"9:18 pm on 26 August, 2022: John agreed to meet James at McGee's Pub tomorrow (2022-08-27).\",\n    \"9:18 pm on 26 August, 2022: John mentioned he does not like dark beer.\",\n    \"12:37 am on 31 October, 2022: John responded positively to James's statement about the bar and expressed excitement about hearing how it goes.\",\n    \"9:18 pm on 26 August, 2022: John proposed having a beer instead of coffee.\",\n    \"12:37 am on 31 October, 2022: James mentioned that one of the criteria for choosing their apartment was the presence of a particular nearby bar.\",\n    \"7:01 pm on 4 May, 2022: James also likes cheese pizza and prosciutto.\",\n    \"9:23 pm on 4 September, 2022: John looks forward to tasting James's cooking creations.\",\n    \"7:01 pm on 4 May, 2022: John prefers Hawaiian pizza, enjoying the combination of sweet and salty flavors.\",\n    \"6:53 pm on 1 September, 2022: John said he is proud of them and can't wait to see what they come up with.\",\n    \"7:01 pm on 4 May, 2022: John agreed to check out prosciutto and thanked James.\",\n    \"9:23 pm on 4 September, 2022: John expressed surprise at James's desire to cook.\",\n    \"7:01 pm on 4 May, 2022: John said/claims: 'Thanks!

These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references unless instructed to keep them.\n\n    Memories for user James:\n\n    [\n    \"9:32 pm on 20 April, 2022: James responded to John's greeting and shared that last Thursday (originally stated as last Thursday relative to 2022-04-20, i.e., 2022-04-14), he worked with one of his gaming pals on a programming project, combining programming and gaming to create a virtual world inspired by Witcher 3.\",\n    \"6:02 pm on 18 September, 2022: John mentioned that he started getting into board games and tried one last week (time relative to a specific day: 'last week' on 18 September, 2022), which he found a lot of fun; image: https://i.redd.it/eqfmcyv9b2t91.jpg; title: a photo of a table with a laptop and a game on it\",\n    \"9:52 am on 12 April, 2022: John came across an error in the game on 2022-04-11 (originally stated as yesterday relative to 2022-04-12, i.e., 2022-04-11)\",\n    \"8:57 pm on 7 November, 2022: John worked with a game developer on a project during his weekend\",\n    \"8:57 pm on 7 November, 2022: John described the experience of working on the project as incredible\",\n    \"12:40 am on 27 March, 2022: John responded positively to James's interest in new game genres and encouraged him to explore them.

{"data_source": "evaluation_metrics_20251221_094611_combined", "prompt": [{"content": "\n    You are an intelligent memory assistant tasked with retrieving accurate information from conversation memories.\n\n    # CONTEXT:\n    You have access to memories from two speakers in a conversation. These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references unless instructed to keep them.\n\n    Memories for user James:\n\n    [\n    \"3:47 pm on 17 March, 2022: John proposed alternative activities such as playing slot machines and arcades.\",\n    \"7:36 pm on 21 October, 2022: John organized a programming seminar last week (time relative to a specific day: 'last week').

{"data_source": "evaluation_metrics_20251221_094611_combined", "prompt": [{"content": "\n    You are an intelligent memory assistant tasked with retrieving accurate information from conversation memories.\n\n    # CONTEXT:\n    You have access to memories from two speakers in a conversation. These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1.

{"data_source": "evaluation_metrics_20251221_094611_combined", "prompt": [{"content": "\n    You are an intelligent memory assistant tasked with retrieving accurate information from conversation memories.\n\n    # CONTEXT:\n    You have access to memories from two speakers in a conversation. These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references unless instructed to keep them.\n\n    Memories for user James:\n\n    [\n    \"1:45 pm on 6 August, 2022: John mentioned organizing a tournament with his friends on 2022-05-07 (originally stated as yesterday relative to 2022-05-08, i.e., 2022-05-07) for their favorite game, CS:GO; image: https://i.redd.it/eh02fep1qnw01.jpg; title: a photo of a wooden table with a game controller on it.

{"data_source": "evaluation_metrics_20251221_094611_combined", "prompt": [{"content": "\n    You are an intelligent memory assistant tasked with retrieving accurate information from conversation memories.\n\n    # CONTEXT:\n    You have access to memories from two speakers in a conversation. These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references unless instructed to keep them.\n\n    Memories for user James:\n\n    [\n    \"9:23 pm on 4 September, 2022: James asked Samantha to become his girlfriend on 2022-09-03 (originally stated as yesterday relative to 2022-09-04) and she agreed.\",\n    \"12:37 am on 31 October, 2022: James said that he and Samantha have decided to move in together.\",\n    \"9:23 pm on 4 September, 2022: James and Samantha are going to a baseball game on 4 September, 2022, and James invited John to join.\",\n    \"9:16 am on 10 August, 2022: James met a girl named Samantha during the beach outing and is thinking of asking her out on a date.\",\n    \"9:23 pm on 4 September, 2022: James and Samantha were at the theater, where James proposed to Samantha.\",\n    \"9:23 pm on 4 September, 2022: James and Samantha have many things in common.\",\n    \"1:45 pm on 6 August, 2022: James said 'Leaving after 3 years is a big step - how did it feel?'\",\n    \"9:23 pm on 4 September, 2022: James and Samantha went to McGee's bar, where Samantha was found to love lager beer.\",\n    \"9:16 am on 10 August, 2022: James has Samantha's phone number and plans to call her tomorrow (originally stated as tomorrow relative to 2022-08-10, i.e., 2022-08-11).\",\n    \"9:23 pm on 4 September, 2022: John asked James if he had anything new besides the great news about James and Samantha.\",\n    \"7:36 pm on 21 October, 2022: James mentioned that his mother came to see him with her army friend two days ago (originally stated as two days ago relative to 2022-10-21, i.e., 2022-10-19).\",\n    \"9:32 pm on 20 April, 2022: James suggests going somewhere together next year.

These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references unless instructed to keep them.\n\n    Memories for user James:\n\n    [\n    \"8:57 pm on 7 November, 2022: James visited his friends Josh and Mark during the road trip\",\n    \"8:57 pm on 7 November, 2022: James mentioned that on the way to Mark and Josh, they visited an animal sanctuary and saw many cute rescue dogs\",\n    \"8:57 pm on 7 November, 2022: James and John started a road trip on 2022-11-04 (originally stated as yesterday relative to 2022-11-05).

{"data_source": "evaluation_metrics_20251221_094611_combined", "prompt": [{"content": "\n    You are an intelligent memory assistant tasked with retrieving accurate information from conversation memories.\n\n    # CONTEXT:\n    You have access to memories from two speakers in a conversation. These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references unless instructed to keep them.\n\n    Memories for user James:\n\n    [\n    \"5:20 pm on 5 November, 2022: John won the regional chess tournament.

These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7.

{"data_source": "evaluation_metrics_20251221_094611_combined", "prompt": [{"content": "\n    You are an intelligent memory assistant tasked with retrieving accurate information from conversation memories.\n\n    # CONTEXT:\n    You have access to memories from two speakers in a conversation. These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references unless instructed to keep them.\n\n    Memories for user James:\n\n    [\n    \"9:52 am on 12 April, 2022: James adopted a pup from a shelter in Stamford on 2022-04-05 (originally stated as last week relative to 2022-04-12, i.e., 2022-04-05); the pup is named Ned; image: https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0624/9512/9787/files/b7d0234c78c382f9d9fc42142115a987.jpg; title: a photo of a dog and a cat sitting on a dog bed\",\n    \"9:59 pm on 19 June, 2022: James introduced Max, Daisy, and Ned (the new pup) last Friday (originally stated as last Friday relative to 2022-06-19, i.e., 2022-06-17).\",\n    \"6:53 pm on 1 September, 2022: James learned about problem-solving, patience, and perseverance from his project (23 May 2022, 7:33 pm).

{"data_source": "evaluation_metrics_20251221_094611_combined", "prompt": [{"content": "\n    You are an intelligent memory assistant tasked with retrieving accurate information from conversation memories.\n\n    # CONTEXT:\n    You have access to memories from two speakers in a conversation. These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references unless instructed to keep them.\n\n    Memories for user James:\n\n    [\n    \"9:32 pm on 20 April, 2022: Japan has huge screens on buildings that are mesmerizing.

{"data_source": "evaluation_metrics_20251221_094611_combined", "prompt": [{"content": "\n    You are an intelligent memory assistant tasked with retrieving accurate information from conversation memories.\n\n    # CONTEXT:\n    You have access to memories from two speakers in a conversation. These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references unless instructed to keep them.\n\n    Memories for user James:\n\n    [\n    \"3:47 pm on 17 March, 2022: James is working on a project he has wanted to do since he was a kid; it involves turning childhood sketches of a main character into a computer game\",\n    \"9:32 pm on 20 April, 2022: James responded to John's greeting and shared that last Thursday (originally stated as last Thursday relative to 2022-04-20, i.e., 2022-04-14), he worked with one of his gaming pals on a programming project, combining programming and gaming to create a virtual world inspired by Witcher 3.\",\n    \"6:53 pm on 1 September, 2022: James learned about problem-solving, patience, and perseverance from his project (23 May 2022, 7:33 pm).

These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references unless instructed to keep them.\n\n    Memories for user James:\n\n    [\n    \"5:07 pm on 16 June, 2022: James said Max loves swimming and usually plays in the water at the beach or lake, and is a pro swimmer.

These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references unless instructed to keep them.\n\n    Memories for user James:\n\n    [\n    \"1:45 pm on 6 August, 2022: John said that many people showed up for the CS:GO tournament and they made a bunch of money for charity.

{"data_source": "evaluation_metrics_20251221_094611_combined", "prompt": [{"content": "\n    You are an intelligent memory assistant tasked with retrieving accurate information from conversation memories.\n\n    # CONTEXT:\n    You have access to memories from two speakers in a conversation. These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references unless instructed to keep them.\n\n    Memories for user James:\n\n    [\n    \"1:45 pm on 6 August, 2022: James said his puppy was fine and that the clinic visit was a routine examination.\",\n    \"1:45 pm on 6 August, 2022: James mentioned that his puppy was vaccinated to prevent him from catching the seasonal canine disease.\",\n    \"8:57 pm on 7 November, 2022: James visited an animal sanctuary and found rescue dogs very cute, which made him tempted to take them all home (originally stated as a past event).\",\n    \"1:45 pm on 6 August, 2022: John asked James what happened to his puppy and if it is OK.\",\n    \"1:45 pm on 6 August, 2022: John expressed relief that the puppy is okay and praised James for caring so much about his pets.\",\n    \"9:16 am on 10 August, 2022: James took his three dogs to a beach outing yesterday (originally stated as yesterday relative to 2022-08-10, i.e., 2022-08-09) to have fun and bond with other dogkeepers.\",\n    \"7:01 pm on 4 May, 2022: James mentioned he decided to spend time with his beloved pets again today.\",\n    \"9:59 pm on 19 June, 2022: James mentioned that introducing the three dogs was initially hard but they are now slowly adapting.\",\n    \"8:57 pm on 7 November, 2022: James mentioned that on the way to Mark and Josh, they visited an animal sanctuary and saw many cute rescue dogs\",\n    \"11:04 am on 23 April, 2022: James went on a hike with his dogs last Thursday (time relative to a specific day: 'last Thursday')\",\n    \"8:57 pm on 7 November, 2022: James found the dog adorable and asked for its name.\",\n    \"9:16 am on 10 August, 2022: James took his three dogs to a beach outing on 2022-08-09 (originally stated as yesterday relative to 2022-08-10, i.e., 2022-08-09) to have fun and bond with other dogkeepers.\",\n    \"8:57 pm on 7 November, 2022: James agrees that dogs bring joy and friendship, and they make dark days better.\",\n    \"8:57 pm on 7 November, 2022: James considers his dogs as his best buddies and feels he wouldn't know what to do without them.\",\n    \"9:59 pm on 19 June, 2022: James introduced Max, Daisy, and Ned (the new pup) last Friday (originally stated as last Friday relative to 2022-06-19, i.e., 2022-06-17).\",\n    \"9:49 am on 22 July, 2022: James identified the image as his sister and his dogs, explaining they were chilling together yesterday and that they bring happiness to his life.\",\n    \"8:57 pm on 7 November, 2022: John asked James to share more about the visit to the animal sanctuary and if he felt tempted to bring any furry pals home\",\n    \"9:18 pm on 26 August, 2022: John asked James to remind him of his dog's name, Ned\",\n    \"7:36 pm on 21 October, 2022: James mentioned that his mother's friend used to tell stories about their time in the military and their pup.\",\n    \"7:01 pm on 4 May, 2022: James finds joy in the loyalty of his pets.\",\n    \"9:49 am on 22 July, 2022: James expressed gratitude for having a close bond with his sister and dogs, describing their time together as a family experience.\",\n    \"7:01 pm on 4 May, 2022: James has two other pets, which are shepherds, according to John's observation.\",\n    \"1:45 pm on 6 August, 2022: James said his pets are the source of his joy and that he will always take care of them.\",\n    \"7:01 pm on 4 May, 2022: James has a pet named Daisy who is a Labrador and loves to play with her toys and eat.\",\n    \"9:52 am on 12 April, 2022: James adopted a pup from a shelter in Stamford on 2022-04-05 (originally stated as last week relative to 2022-04-12, i.e., 2022-04-05); the pup is named Ned; image: https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0624/9512/9787/files/b7d0234c78c382f9d9fc42142115a987.jpg; title: a photo of a dog and a cat sitting on a dog bed\",\n    \"9:23 pm on 4 September, 2022: John congratulated James on finding someone other than dogs that brings him joy and claimed he will succeed.\",\n    \"2:36 pm on 29 April, 2022: James mentioned that while playing a game, his dog Daisy came and lay down next to him, which he found cute.; image: https://i.redd.it/qjblw3fb7hnb1.jpg; title: a photo of a dog laying on a bed with a computer in the background\",\n    \"9:26 pm on 20 March, 2022: James said his dogs can do tricks like sit, stay, paw, and rollover, and shared an image of Daisy waiting for a treat; image: https://i.redd.it/bd7160b2t6aa1.jpg; title: a photo of a dog laying on a bed with a name tag.\",\n    \"9:18 pm on 26 August, 2022: James mentioned his dog Ned came to him today (2022-08-26) while he was playing on the console; image: https://i.redd.it/8nlwyc5nh6d61.jpg; title: a photo of a person holding a dog on a couch\",\n    \"2:36 pm on 29 April, 2022: James said that his dogs often come to him while he is gaming and hug him; they are his good cuddle buddies.

For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references unless instructed to keep them.\n\n    Memories for user James:\n\n    [\n    \"9:23 pm on 4 September, 2022: James made meringue at the first lesson of the cooking class.\",\n    \"9:23 pm on 4 September, 2022: James made a great omelette the first time he participated in the cooking class.\",\n    \"9:23 pm on 4 September, 2022: James learned how to make dough at the first lesson of the cooking class.\",\n    \"9:23 pm on 4 September, 2022: James prepared several simple dishes at the first lesson of the cooking class.\",\n    \"9:23 pm on 4 September, 2022: James signed up for a cooking class two days ago (originally stated as two days ago relative to 2022-09-04, i.e., 2022-08-31).\",\n    \"9:23 pm on 4 September, 2022: James hopes to treat John to his cooking creations once he learns more about cooking.\",\n    \"9:23 pm on 4 September, 2022: John expressed surprise at James's desire to cook.\",\n    \"9:23 pm on 4 September, 2022: John looks forward to tasting James's cooking creations.\",\n    \"7:01 pm on 4 May, 2022: James also likes cheese pizza and prosciutto.\",\n    \"7:01 pm on 4 May, 2022: James loves pizza, particularly pepperoni, which he describes as an amazing combination of spicy salami and cheese.\",\n    \"3:57 pm on 21 August, 2022: James said it's cool when the final product is done and you know you were a part of making something awesome.\",\n    \"3:47 pm on 17 March, 2022: James wished John good luck in the programming class; (originally stated as 'Good luck in the class!')\",\n    \"6:53 pm on 1 September, 2022: James learned about problem-solving, patience, and perseverance from his project (23 May 2022, 7:33 pm).

{"data_source": "evaluation_metrics_20251221_094611_combined", "prompt": [{"content": "\n    You are an intelligent memory assistant tasked with retrieving accurate information from conversation memories.\n\n    # CONTEXT:\n    You have access to memories from two speakers in a conversation. These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references unless instructed to keep them.\n\n    Memories for user James:\n\n    [\n    \"7:33 pm on 23 May, 2022: James congratulated John on his achievement and mentioned that last month he had a personal milestone involving a big project (23 May 2022, 7:33 pm).\",\n    \"7:33 pm on 23 May, 2022: John congratulated James on his milestone and acknowledged the skills he gained (23 May 2022, 7:33 pm).\",\n    \"5:20 pm on 5 November, 2022: John had a great accomplishment on 5 November, 2022 (time relative to a specific day: '5 November, 2022').\",\n    \"9:59 pm on 19 June, 2022: John is considering volunteer roles and potentially a career in the non-profit sector (Future plans: influenced by the experience).

{"data_source": "evaluation_metrics_20251221_094611_combined", "prompt": [{"content": "\n    You are an intelligent memory assistant tasked with retrieving accurate information from conversation memories.\n\n    # CONTEXT:\n    You have access to memories from two speakers in a conversation. These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references unless instructed to keep them.\n\n    Memories for user James:\n\n    [\n    \"8:56 pm on 20 September, 2022: John said that he uses tutorials and developer forums to improve his game design skills, emphasizing the importance of staying informed and constantly learning.\",\n    \"8:56 pm on 20 September, 2022: John mentioned that he also reads a magazine, which provides tutorials, interviews with developers, and tips that are helpful for game design.\",\n    \"9:20 am on 3 October, 2022: John finds mentoring programmers to make games exciting and inspiring\",\n    \"1:45 pm on 6 August, 2022: John enjoys games that test his strategizing and finds them satisfying when plans work out and he wins.

{"data_source": "evaluation_metrics_20251221_094611_combined", "prompt": [{"content": "\n    You are an intelligent memory assistant tasked with retrieving accurate information from conversation memories.\n\n    # CONTEXT:\n    You have access to memories from two speakers in a conversation. These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references unless instructed to keep them.\n\n    Memories for user James:\n\n    [\n    \"9:23 pm on 4 September, 2022: James asked Samantha to become his girlfriend on 2022-09-03 (originally stated as yesterday relative to 2022-09-04) and she agreed.\",\n    \"9:23 pm on 4 September, 2022: James and Samantha are going to a baseball game on 4 September, 2022, and James invited John to join.\",\n    \"12:37 am on 31 October, 2022: James said that he and Samantha have decided to move in together.\",\n    \"9:16 am on 10 August, 2022: James has Samantha's phone number and plans to call her tomorrow (originally stated as tomorrow relative to 2022-08-10, i.e., 2022-08-11).\",\n    \"7:01 pm on 4 May, 2022: James said that on 2022-04-29, something happened on his project that he had been working on for weeks, which caused him frustration.\",\n    \"9:23 pm on 4 September, 2022: James and Samantha were at the theater, where James proposed to Samantha.\",\n    \"5:20 pm on 5 November, 2022: James accepted John's offer and expressed interest in checking out resources on chess openings.

{"data_source": "evaluation_metrics_20251221_094611_combined", "prompt": [{"content": "\n    You are an intelligent memory assistant tasked with retrieving accurate information from conversation memories.\n\n    # CONTEXT:\n    You have access to memories from two speakers in a conversation. These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references unless instructed to keep them.\n\n    Memories for user James:\n\n    [\n    \"9:23 pm on 4 September, 2022: James asked Samantha to become his girlfriend on 2022-09-03 (originally stated as yesterday relative to 2022-09-04) and she agreed.\",\n    \"12:37 am on 31 October, 2022: James said that he and Samantha have decided to move in together.\",\n    \"9:23 pm on 4 September, 2022: James and Samantha are going to a baseball game on 4 September, 2022, and James invited John to join.\",\n    \"9:23 pm on 4 September, 2022: James and Samantha were at the theater, where James proposed to Samantha.\",\n    \"9:23 pm on 4 September, 2022: James and Samantha went to McGee's bar, where Samantha was found to love lager beer.\",\n    \"9:23 pm on 4 September, 2022: James and Samantha have many things in common.\",\n    \"9:16 am on 10 August, 2022: James has Samantha's phone number and plans to call her tomorrow (originally stated as tomorrow relative to 2022-08-10, i.e., 2022-08-11).\",\n    \"9:16 am on 10 August, 2022: James met a girl named Samantha during the beach outing and is thinking of asking her out on a date.\",\n    \"9:23 pm on 4 September, 2022: John asked James if he had anything new besides the great news about James and Samantha.\",\n    \"7:36 pm on 21 October, 2022: James mentioned that his mother came to see him with her army friend two days ago (originally stated as two days ago relative to 2022-10-21, i.e., 2022-10-19).\",\n    \"8:57 pm on 7 November, 2022: James and John started a road trip on 2022-11-04 (originally stated as yesterday relative to 2022-11-05).

These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4.
