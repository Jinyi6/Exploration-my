{"data_source": "evaluation_metrics_20260107_181429_combined", "prompt": [{"content": "\n    You are an intelligent memory assistant tasked with retrieving accurate information from conversation memories.\n\n    # CONTEXT:\n    You have access to memories from two speakers in a conversation. These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories from both speakers\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps to determine the answer\n    3. If the question asks about a specific event or fact, look for direct evidence in the memories\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory\n    5. If there is a question about time references (like \"last year\", \"two months ago\", etc.), \n       calculate the actual date based on the memory timestamp. For example, if a memory from \n       4 May 2022 mentions \"went to India last year,\" then the trip occurred in 2021.\n    6. Always convert relative time references to specific dates, months, or years. For example, \n       convert \"last year\" to \"2022\" or \"two months ago\" to \"March 2023\" based on the memory \n       timestamp. Ignore the reference while answering the question.\n    7. Focus only on the content of the memories from both speakers. Do not confuse character \n       names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n    8. The answer should be less than 5-6 words.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question\n    4. If the answer requires calculation (e.g., converting relative time references), show your work\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked\n    7.

If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory\n    5. If there is a question about time references (like \"last year\", \"two months ago\", etc.), \n       calculate the actual date based on the memory timestamp. For example, if a memory from \n       4 May 2022 mentions \"went to India last year,\" then the trip occurred in 2021.\n    6. Always convert relative time references to specific dates, months, or years. For example, \n       convert \"last year\" to \"2022\" or \"two months ago\" to \"March 2023\" based on the memory \n       timestamp. Ignore the reference while answering the question.\n    7. Focus only on the content of the memories from both speakers. Do not confuse character \n       names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n    8. The answer should be less than 5-6 words.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question\n    4. If the answer requires calculation (e.g., converting relative time references), show your work\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked\n    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references\n\n    Memories for user Audrey:\n\n    [\n    \"9:58 pm on 16 August, 2023: Audrey said her dogs keep her busy and she wants to make sure she gives each of them the attention they deserve.\",\n    \"2:03 pm on 11 May, 2023: Audrey stated that she thinks positive reinforcement is a must-learn for any dog owner.\",\n    \"2:03 pm on 11 May, 2023: Audrey expressed excitement about learning how to train her dogs better.\",\n    \"1:10 pm on 27 March, 2023: Audrey's dogs are named Pepper, Precious, and Panda\",\n    \"4:18 pm on 4 October, 2023: Audrey said she will say hi to Andrew's dogs and take care\",\n    \"9:19 pm on 19 August, 2023: Audrey gives advice to city-dwellers who own a pup, saying they need enough time and energy for the pup, as well as lots of attention and walks, especially for a German Shepherd like Toby, who needs to offset a lot of energy.

For example, if a memory from \n       4 May 2022 mentions \"went to India last year,\" then the trip occurred in 2021.\n    6. Always convert relative time references to specific dates, months, or years. For example, \n       convert \"last year\" to \"2022\" or \"two months ago\" to \"March 2023\" based on the memory \n       timestamp. Ignore the reference while answering the question.\n    7. Focus only on the content of the memories from both speakers. Do not confuse character \n       names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n    8. The answer should be less than 5-6 words.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question\n    4. If the answer requires calculation (e.g., converting relative time references), show your work\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked\n    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references\n\n    Memories for user Audrey:\n\n    [\n    \"4:19 pm on 16 April, 2023: Audrey finds it amazing that Andrew and his girlfriend enjoy exploring the city through new places and food.\",\n    \"12:24 am on 24 August, 2023: Andrew loves Toby and is excited about the future adventures they may have together.\",\n    \"5:53 pm on 24 September, 2023: Andrew asked if they enjoy playing in the garden.\",\n    \"5:23 pm on 13 June, 2023: Andrew agrees that something is really nice.\",\n    \"1:10 pm on 27 March, 2023: Andrew is jealous of Audrey's fun outings with her dogs\",\n    \"6:12 pm on 19 October, 2023: Andrew mentioned that he and Buddy enjoy doing walks together as a great way to spend time and get some fresh air; image: https://www.kingdukes.com/cdn/shop/articles/man_walking_dog_on_portland_trail_1200x.jpg; title: a photo of a man walking a dog on a trail\",\n    \"11:05 am on 4 August, 2023: Andrew agrees that sharing enjoyable activities with someone brings joy and love.
