Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked\n    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references\n\n    **Note. Time Calculation (Simplified Rules):**\n    \n    * **Pre-check for date questions**: Before writing the final answer, verify that your handling of time expressions follows the rules below.\n    \n    * **Weekday-based expressions** (e.g., \"last Friday\", \"this Tuesday\", \"next weekend\"): **never compute an absolute calendar date**. Answer using a **relative phrase anchored to the memory’s timestamp**.\n    \n      **Standard format QA examples:**\n    \n      * **Q:** The memory (timestamp **14 August 2023**) says the event was **“last Friday.”** How should I state the time?\n        **A:** **“last Friday before 14 August 2023.”**\n      * **Q:** The memory (timestamp **17 July 2023**) mentions **“this Tuesday.”** How should I state the time?\n        **A:** **“the Tuesday after 17 July 2023.”**\n    \n    * **Non-weekday relative expressions** that can be computed **without calendar lookup** (e.g., \"yesterday\", \"last month\", \"last year\"): you **may convert** to an absolute value when the year/month/day can be derived directly from the timestamp.\n    \n    QA examples (memory timestamp: 2023-08-14):\n    \n    Q: What is “yesterday”?\n    A: 2023-08-13\n    (Anti-example ❌: yesterday of 2023-08-13.”**)\n    Q: What is “last month”?\n    A: 2023-07\n    (Anti-example ❌: last month of 2023-08.”**)\n    Q: What is “last year”?\n    A: 2022\n    (Anti-example ❌: last year of 2023.”**)\n    * **Time granularity**: Do not over-specify. Keep vague phrases (\"last week\", \"recently\", \"a few months ago\") as-is and anchor them to the timestamp.\n    Q: The memory says “last week.” What date is that?\n    A: Do **not** compute exact dates. Answer as **“last week before 2023-08-14.”**\n    (Anti-example ❌: specifying exact dates like **“2023-08-07 to 2023-08-13.”**)\n\n    * **Conversation time vs. event time**: Distinguish carefully. If the question asks **when the event happened**, do not answer with the conversation time.\n    \n      **QA example (two memories):**\n      *Memory A (timestamp **14 August 2023**): “Went to the city **last Friday**.”*\n      *Memory B (timestamp **16 August 2023**): “**Will go again next Tuesday.**”*\n    \n      **Q:** When did they go to the city?\n      **A:** **“last Friday before 14 August 2023.”**\n      **Anti-examples ❌:**\n      • “On **16 August 2023**” (this is the conversation/memory time, not the event time).\n    * **Tense**: Ensure past/future tense matches the event.\n      **Anti-examples ❌:**\n      • “They went last Friday **and will go again next Tuesday**” (the question asks only about the past event).\n    \n    Memories for user Jon:\n\n    [\n    \"3:14 pm on 11 May, 2023: Gina had an interview for a design internship yesterday (originally stated as yesterday relative to May 11, 2023, i.e., May 10, 2023).\",\n    \"4:04 pm on 20 January, 2023: Gina used to compete in dance competitions and shows.\",\n    \"2:35 pm on 16 March, 2023: Gina has been having some tough times lately.\",\n    \"10:04 am on 19 June, 2023: Gina is looking forward to having fun at Jon's dance studio.\",\n    \"1:26 pm on 3 April, 2023: Gina is focused on building her customer base and making her store a top destination for fashion fans.\",\n    \"7:18 pm on 27 May, 2023: Gina found a cool new fashion piece for her store and is excited to share it with her customers.
