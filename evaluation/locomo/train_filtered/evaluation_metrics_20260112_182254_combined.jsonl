These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories from both speakers\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps to determine the answer\n    3. If the question asks about a specific event or fact, look for direct evidence in the memories\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory\n    5. If there is a question about time references (like \"last year\", \"two months ago\", etc.), \n       calculate the actual date based on the memory timestamp. For example, if a memory from \n       4 May 2022 mentions \"went to India last year,\" then the trip occurred in 2021.\n    6. Always convert relative time references to specific dates, months, or years. For example, \n       convert \"last year\" to \"2022\" or \"two months ago\" to \"March 2023\" based on the memory \n       timestamp. Ignore the reference while answering the question.\n    7. Focus only on the content of the memories from both speakers. Do not confuse character \n       names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n    8. The answer should be less than 5-6 words.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question\n    4. If the answer requires calculation (e.g., converting relative time references), show your work\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked\n    7.

These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories from both speakers\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps to determine the answer\n    3. If the question asks about a specific event or fact, look for direct evidence in the memories\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory\n    5. If there is a question about time references (like \"last year\", \"two months ago\", etc.), \n       calculate the actual date based on the memory timestamp. For example, if a memory from \n       4 May 2022 mentions \"went to India last year,\" then the trip occurred in 2021.\n    6. Always convert relative time references to specific dates, months, or years. For example, \n       convert \"last year\" to \"2022\" or \"two months ago\" to \"March 2023\" based on the memory \n       timestamp. Ignore the reference while answering the question.\n    7. Focus only on the content of the memories from both speakers. Do not confuse character \n       names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n    8. The answer should be less than 5-6 words.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question\n    4. If the answer requires calculation (e.g., converting relative time references), show your work\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked\n    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references\n\n    Memories for user Caroline:\n\n    [\n    \"6:55 pm on 20 October, 2023: Melanie thought a lot about how much she needs her family after the accident.\",\n    \"6:55 pm on 20 October, 2023: Melanie's son was okay after the accident.\",\n    \"6:55 pm on 20 October, 2023: Melanie was freaked when her son got into an accident during the roadtrip.\",\n    \"6:55 pm on 20 October, 2023: Melanie was scared when they got into the accident.\",\n    \"6:55 pm on 20 October, 2023: Melanie's son's accident was a reminder that life is precious and to cherish family.\",\n    \"6:55 pm on 20 October, 2023: Melanie agreed with Caroline that family is everything and that they are super important, especially after the accident.\",\n    \"6:55 pm on 20 October, 2023: Caroline expressed sympathy for the accident and said it must have been traumatizing for Melanie and her family.\",\n    \"7:55 pm on 9 June, 2023: Melanie stated that time with family makes her feel alive and happy (Melanie's statement).\",\n    \"1:14 pm on 25 May, 2023: Melanie is able to better look after her family when she takes care of herself.\",\n    \"7:55 pm on 9 June, 2023: Melanie said that her family motivates her and gives her love.\",\n    \"10:31 am on 13 October, 2023: Melanie feels like she should adopt after hearing about her friend's experience on 13 October, 2023.\",\n    \"6:55 pm on 20 October, 2023: Melanie's family means the world to her and she is thankful to have them.\",\n    \"10:37 am on 27 June, 2023: Caroline responded that family moments like Melanie's are special and expressed gladness that Melanie had a great time.\",\n    \"1:51 pm on 15 July, 2023: Melanie said she was getting there, and that creativity and family keep her at peace.\",\n    \"8:56 pm on 20 July, 2023: Melanie thanked Caroline and said she is really lucky to have her family, as they bring so much joy and love\",\n    \"7:55 pm on 9 June, 2023: Caroline commented that Melanie's family photo looked happy and asked how the day was.\",\n    \"6:55 pm on 20 October, 2023: Melanie and her son were involved in an accident during a roadtrip this past weekend (originally stated as this past weekend, i.e., 2023-10-01 to 2023-10-02), which was a scary experience but they were lucky he was okay.\",\n    \"1:51 pm on 15 July, 2023: Caroline asked Melanie how her family had been supportive during her move.\",\n    \"10:37 am on 27 June, 2023: Melanie noted that the two younger kids in her family love nature and that it was special having these moments together as a family.\",\n    \"1:51 pm on 15 July, 2023: Melanie mentioned that her family had helped her through tough times and that they went on another camping trip in the forest;
