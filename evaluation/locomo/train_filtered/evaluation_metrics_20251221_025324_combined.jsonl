These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6.

First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3.

These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7.
