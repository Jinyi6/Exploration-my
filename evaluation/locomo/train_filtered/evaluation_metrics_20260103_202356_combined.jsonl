These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories from both speakers.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (原文指8月的一个月之前)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June/六月初”, “第一个周末”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (如逝者名单、车数、roadtrip 次数、共同点等).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories from speakers. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7.

These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories from both speakers.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (原文指8月的一个月之前)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June/六月初”, “第一个周末”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (如逝者名单、车数、roadtrip 次数、共同点等).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories from speakers. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7.

{"data_source": "evaluation_metrics_20260103_202356_combined", "prompt": [{"content": "\n    You are an intelligent memory assistant tasked with retrieving accurate information from conversation memories.\n\n    # CONTEXT:\n    You have access to memories from two speakers in a conversation. These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories from both speakers.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (原文指8月的一个月之前)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June/六月初”, “第一个周末”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (如逝者名单、车数、roadtrip 次数、共同点等).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories from speakers. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references unless instructed to keep them.\n\n    Memories for user Audrey:\n\n    [\n    \"7:49 pm on 6 September, 2023: Andrew has been adding simple self-care activities to his day, such as grabbing a coffee in the morning and going for walks at lunch, to help him recharge and relax.\",\n    \"1:10 pm on 27 March, 2023: Andrew spots birds when he goes hiking.\",\n    \"9:19 pm on 19 August, 2023: Audrey claims that Andrew's photos of hikes are always nice.\",\n    \"7:49 pm on 6 September, 2023: Andrew enjoys hiking and has been wanting to take Toby hiking with him as a companion for a while.\",\n    \"5:23 pm on 13 June, 2023: Andrew plans to try to do more outdoor activities like rock climbing every week (time relative to a specific day: 'every week').\",\n    \"11:05 am on 4 August, 2023: Andrew claims that hiking is the best outdoor activity for him because the trees and fresh air are refreshing.\",\n    \"8:32 pm on 3 July, 2023: Andrew lives in a city and finds it difficult to take walks in nature or have the same connection and companionship with animals as Audrey does.
