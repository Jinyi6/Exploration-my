{"data_source": "evaluation_metrics_20260108_021133_combined", "prompt": [{"content": "\n    You are an intelligent memory assistant tasked with retrieving accurate information from conversation memories.\n\n    # CONTEXT:\n    You have access to memories from two speakers in a conversation. These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7.

These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1.

{"data_source": "evaluation_metrics_20260108_021133_combined", "prompt": [{"content": "\n    You are an intelligent memory assistant tasked with retrieving accurate information from conversation memories.\n\n    # CONTEXT:\n    You have access to memories from two speakers in a conversation. These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references unless instructed to keep them.\n\n    Memories for user James:\n\n    [\n    \"9:32 pm on 20 April, 2022: James got the inspiration for his game character from a walk with his dogs two weeks ago (time relative to a specific day: '2022-04-20').\",\n    \"9:32 pm on 20 April, 2022: During the walk, James saw a stranger who amazed him with her eyes and appearance, and he felt like he fell in love at first sight.\",\n    \"9:32 pm on 20 April, 2022: John was amazed by James's game character screenshot and asked if the inspiration came from something.\",\n    \"9:32 pm on 20 April, 2022: James didn't approach the stranger but remembered her appearance and embodied it in the game.\",\n    \"7:36 pm on 21 October, 2022: James's passion for gaming was sparked by those games.\",\n    \"9:32 pm on 20 April, 2022: - John and James reconnect, sharing recent experiences: John met new friends in a programming course, while James worked on a Witcher 3-inspired virtual world with a gaming pal.\\n- James created a game character inspired by a stranger he saw during a walk with his dogs two weeks prior.\\n- John visited a serene canyon and shared a photo, emphasizing the inspiration from real-life experiences.\\n- Both mention travel as a source of motivation;

{"data_source": "evaluation_metrics_20260108_021133_combined", "prompt": [{"content": "\n    You are an intelligent memory assistant tasked with retrieving accurate information from conversation memories.\n\n    # CONTEXT:\n    You have access to memories from two speakers in a conversation. These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references unless instructed to keep them.\n\n    Memories for user James:\n\n    [\n    \"6:53 pm on 1 September, 2022: John asked James if he faced any difficulties during development.\",\n    \"6:53 pm on 1 September, 2022: James found it challenging to balance mechanics and ensure fairness in the game but managed through trial and error.\",\n    \"6:53 pm on 1 September, 2022: John asked James what inspired him to create the game.\",\n    \"7:01 pm on 4 May, 2022: James spent hours debugging the issue but couldn't solve it on his own.\",\n    \"7:36 pm on 21 October, 2022: James's passion for gaming was sparked by those games.\",\n    \"7:36 pm on 21 October, 2022: - James experienced a power outage three days ago, which interrupted his game progress and reminded him to save more often.\\n- John organized a programming seminar last week, which was successful and provided him with new insights and techniques.\\n- John will send James resources on the new programming techniques he learned.\\n- James shared a photo of an old Nintendo console and controller, recalling how it sparked his passion for gaming.\\n- James mentioned playing *Cyberpunk 2077* and John advised him to be cautious with character choices, avoiding spoilers.\",\n    \"9:32 pm on 20 April, 2022: James got the inspiration for his game character from a walk with his dogs two weeks ago (time relative to a specific day: '2022-04-20').\",\n    \"7:01 pm on 4 May, 2022: \\n\\n- On 4 May 2022 at 7:01 pm, James shared frustration over a bug disrupting his game project, which he resolved with friends.  \\n- James owns a Labrador named Daisy and two shepherds, emphasizing their loyalty and joy in his life.  \\n- Both John and James expressed love for pizza: James prefers pepperoni, cheese, and prosciutto; John favors Hawaiian.  \\n- John invited James to join his day-off movie night, which James accepted.  \\n- A photo of Daisy and the shepherds playing was shared, along with a pizza image captioned \\\"pineapples and ham on a wooden board.\\\"\",\n    \"11:04 am on 23 April, 2022: \\n\\n- On 23 April 2022 at 11:04 am, John and James discussed James's recent hike with his dogs on 15 April 2022, sharing a photo of the trail.  \\n- John revealed he\\u2019s struggling with a complex coding project involving an algorithm, feeling stuck and frustrated.  \\n- James advised breaking the problem into smaller steps, researching similar algorithms, and seeking programmer input for solutions.  \\n- John expressed gratitude for the support and commitment to persist with the project.\",\n    \"7:36 pm on 21 October, 2022: James lost some of his gaming progress because he forgot to save.\",\n    \"6:53 pm on 1 September, 2022: James finished his Unity strategy game after a long period of development and is proud of the result.\",\n    \"7:01 pm on 4 May, 2022: James mentioned having a frustrating experience with a project last Friday (originally stated as last Friday relative to 2022-05-04, i.e., 2022-04-29) due to a bug in the code that messed up the game mechanics.\",\n    \"3:47 pm on 17 March, 2022: John expressed interest in helping James with his game, citing his knowledge of HTML\",\n    \"9:20 am on 3 October, 2022: James is considering playing Cyberpunk 2077 and asked John for his opinion\",\n    \"8:56 pm on 20 September, 2022: James said he also finds the magazine to be a good resource for improving his game dev skills\",\n    \"3:47 pm on 17 March, 2022: James shared a sad story about the last time he played slot machines, where he didn't notice his wallet being taken out of his pocket\",\n    \"6:53 pm on 1 September, 2022: John asked James to show more screenshots of his game.\",\n    \"2:14 pm on 13 October, 2022: John congratulated James on releasing his game and asked if it was fulfilling to see players engage with the game world he created\",\n    \"3:57 pm on 21 August, 2022: James hosted a gaming marathon with some friends, which they had a blast at.

These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6.

{"data_source": "evaluation_metrics_20260108_021133_combined", "prompt": [{"content": "\n    You are an intelligent memory assistant tasked with retrieving accurate information from conversation memories.\n\n    # CONTEXT:\n    You have access to memories from two speakers in a conversation. These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references unless instructed to keep them.\n\n    Memories for user James:\n\n    [\n    \"5:20 pm on 5 November, 2022: John said/claims that he is currently playing FIFA 23\",\n    \"8:56 pm on 20 September, 2022: John has been working on his mobile game for the past few months\",\n    \"9:23 pm on 4 September, 2022: John is hoping the new devices will improve his gaming skills.\",\n    \"12:40 am on 27 March, 2022: John said he is always looking to improve his gaming skills and set new goals\",\n    \"12:40 am on 27 March, 2022: John said he is inspired to improve his gaming skills by watching skilled players\",\n    \"5:20 pm on 5 November, 2022: - On November 5, 2022, James and John discussed John's recent win in the regional chess tournament on Tuesday.\\n- John shared his strategy of analyzing and anticipating opponents' moves, and offered James resources on chess openings.\\n- James expressed interest in trying FIFA 23, a sports game John enjoys, and plans to practice before playing together.\",\n    \"9:52 am on 12 April, 2022: John is playing a new RPG with a cool story and world; the game is set in a futuristic dystopia\",\n    \"2:13 pm on 4 April, 2022: - John congratulated James on his recent game win and shared a photo of his drum kit, revealing he's been playing drums for a month.\\nThe event: James joined an online gaming tournament yesterday (originally stated as yesterday relative to 2022-04-04, i.e., 2022-04-03).; image: https://cool4dads.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_9117.jpg; title: a photo of a group of people posing for a picture\\n- James did pretty well in the tournament; he made it to the semis and won some rounds.\\n- James did not get a chance to take a photo with the whole team he met at the tournament, but one of them gave him a couple of gaming tips.\\n- James was very happy about receiving autographs from the whole team.; image: https://i.redd.it/shafojm1o4471.jpg; title: a photo of a notepad with a pen and a glass of water\\n- The most important advice James remembers from the team is that he always needs to communicate correctly with the team and never put his ego above team success.\\n- James usually uses voice chat to communicate with his team because it is fast and helps them work together effectively.\\n- James has been playing his favourite game called Apex Legends with his team, and it is intense.; image: https://i.redd.it/4zewk2444ag71.jpg; title: a photo of a video game screen showing a robot and a robot\\n- Apex Legends has awesome graphics and super fast-paced gameplay, which makes it stand out among other games.\\n- James is excited to try new games, such as RPGs and MOBAs.; image: https://i.redd.it/bwoh4be8d3m41.jpg; title: a photo of a video game cover of a video game\\n- James plans to let John know his thoughts on the new genres once he tries them out.\\n- John congratulated James on his performance and making it to the semifinals.\\n- John said that comms and teamwork are super important in gaming and that it's incredible what can be accomplished in a match when everyone works together.\\n- John expressed interest in hearing about James's experience with new games and suggested that RPGs and MOBAs can be awesome for experiencing an engaging story or having epic multiplayer fights.\\n- John and James agreed to chat soon and stay in touch.\",\n    \"12:40 am on 27 March, 2022: James asked John what game he played in the tournament\",\n    \"7:36 pm on 21 October, 2022: John requested to see the photo of James playing on their old gaming setup.\",\n    \"9:16 am on 10 August, 2022: John is playing an RPG called 'The Witcher 3' and is impressed by its storytelling and characters (originally stated as 'Hooked a new RPG that I've been playing lately!
