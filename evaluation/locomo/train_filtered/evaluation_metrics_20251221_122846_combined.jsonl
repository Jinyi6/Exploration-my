{"data_source": "evaluation_metrics_20251221_122846_combined", "prompt": [{"content": "\n    You are an intelligent memory assistant tasked with retrieving accurate information from conversation memories.\n\n    # CONTEXT:\n    You have access to memories from two speakers in a conversation. These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references unless instructed to keep them.\n\n    Memories for user Deborah:\n\n    [\n    \"9:48 am on 4 February, 2023: Deborah mentions an amulet from her mom that she brings with her to feel her love and stay close to her, which brings her comfort.

{"data_source": "evaluation_metrics_20251221_122846_combined", "prompt": [{"content": "\n    You are an intelligent memory assistant tasked with retrieving accurate information from conversation memories.\n\n    # CONTEXT:\n    You have access to memories from two speakers in a conversation. These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references unless instructed to keep them.\n\n    Memories for user Deborah:\n\n    [\n    \"4:06 pm on 23 January, 2023: Yoga helped Deborah find peace during a rough time (stated as the inspiration for her route).\",\n    \"2:58 pm on 16 August, 2023: Deborah mentions that nature can be helpful for finding peace.

These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references unless instructed to keep them.\n\n    Memories for user Deborah:\n\n    [\n    \"9:49 am on 27 January, 2023: Deborah received a letter from group members thanking her for her positive influence on them; image: https://i.redd.it/lr823iakg38b1.jpg; title: a photo of a note written to someone on a piece of paper.\",\n    \"4:12 pm on 22 February, 2023: Deborah received a letter from group members thanking her for her positive influence on them; image: https://i.redd.it/lr823iakg38b1.jpg; title: a photo of a note written to someone on a piece of paper.

{"data_source": "evaluation_metrics_20251221_122846_combined", "prompt": [{"content": "\n    You are an intelligent memory assistant tasked with retrieving accurate information from conversation memories.\n\n    # CONTEXT:\n    You have access to memories from two speakers in a conversation. These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references unless instructed to keep them.\n\n    Memories for user Deborah:\n\n    [\n    \"9:49 am on 27 January, 2023: Jolene asked Deborah about other hobbies her mother had.

These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references unless instructed to keep them.\n\n    Memories for user Deborah:\n\n    [\n    \"4:12 pm on 22 February, 2023: Deborah mentioned she has traveled to a few places and that Bali was one of her favorites last year.

{"data_source": "evaluation_metrics_20251221_122846_combined", "prompt": [{"content": "\n    You are an intelligent memory assistant tasked with retrieving accurate information from conversation memories.\n\n    # CONTEXT:\n    You have access to memories from two speakers in a conversation. These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references unless instructed to keep them.\n\n    Memories for user Deborah:\n\n    [\n    \"9:49 am on 27 January, 2023: Jolene bought Seraphim a year ago in Paris (originally stated as a year ago relative to 2023-01-27, i.e., 2022-01-27).\",\n    \"9:26 am on 1 August, 2023: Jolene adopted her pet two years ago when she was feeling lonely and wanted some company.\",\n    \"9:17 am on 26 June, 2023: Jolene mentioned she bought a new aquarium the day before yesterday (i.e., 2023-06-24).\",\n    \"7:18 pm on 2 March, 2023: Jolene took Seraphim to the park last Sunday (time relative to a specific day: 'last Sunday'), and Seraphim loved it.\",\n    \"9:49 am on 27 January, 2023: Jolene has another snake named Seraphim.\",\n    \"3:09 pm on 15 September, 2023: Deborah asked Jolene if the pet in the image was Susie or Seraphim and how long Susie had been with her\",\n    \"9:49 am on 27 January, 2023: Jolene bought something a year ago in Paris.\",\n    \"9:26 am on 1 August, 2023: Jolene adopted Susie two years ago when she was feeling lonely and wanted some company (on 1 August, 2023).\",\n    \"12:52 am on 19 August, 2023: Jolene bought a console for her partner on the 17th and it's so much fun; image: https://i.redd.it/90qd3jqxi2781.jpg; title: a photo of a black xbox console with a yoda yoda figure next to it.\",\n    \"7:37 pm on 9 July, 2023: Jolene was fascinated by reptiles and found them to be the perfect pet for her.\",\n    \"9:49 am on 27 January, 2023: Jolene shared a fun moment where Seraphim slinked out of her cage while she was playing video games and coiled up next to her.\",\n    \"3:09 pm on 15 September, 2023: Jolene confirmed that the pet in the image is Susie and stated that she has had her for two years\",\n    \"9:49 am on 27 January, 2023: Jolene shared an image of Seraphim with a caption describing a snake sticking its head out of a blanket; image: https://i.redd.it/8aunav15kyq01.jpg; title: a photo of a snake sticking its head out of a blanket\",\n    \"9:17 am on 26 June, 2023: An image was shared by Jolene showing a snake named Seraphim curled up in a plant filled area; image: https://i.redd.it/6moonjm3bypa1.jpg; title: a photo of a snake curled up in a plant filled area.\",\n    \"9:26 am on 1 August, 2023: Jolene mentioned that Susie helps her when times get tough, and that pets and video games have been a distraction (on 1 August, 2023); image: https://i.redd.it/0uzy21np69b51.jpg; title: a photo of a man holding a snake on his arm\",\n    \"5:33 pm on 26 August, 2023: Jolene praised Deborah for becoming a loving owner of the pets.\",\n    \"3:09 pm on 15 September, 2023: Jolene has a pet named Susie who has been with her for two years; image: https://i.redd.it/ckp5j9w7q7q41.jpg; title: a photo of a person holding a snake in a container\",\n    \"9:49 am on 27 January, 2023: Jolene's pet snake helps her feel calm and happy.\",\n    \"7:37 pm on 9 July, 2023: Jolene shared a favorite memory involving her pet, which she referred to as a 'snake adventure'.\",\n    \"9:26 am on 1 August, 2023: Jolene said that having her pet around shows her she can stay strong and find joy in the small stuff.\",\n    \"9:26 am on 1 August, 2023: Deborah mentioned that having a pet teaches responsibility and that the pet came at the perfect time for Jolene.\",\n    \"7:37 pm on 9 July, 2023: During the 'snake adventure', Jolene's pet snake escaped and she spent hours searching for it.\",\n    \"5:33 pm on 26 August, 2023: Jolene expressed pride in Deborah's action to tame these pets.\",\n    \"7:37 pm on 9 July, 2023: Taking care of her reptile pet has been calming for Jolene and helps her connect with nature.\",\n    \"7:37 pm on 9 July, 2023: Jolene owns snakes and mentions that they do not run\",\n    \"7:03 pm on 1 February, 2023: Jolene felt a mix of emotions - excited and nervous - when she first received the project (originally stated on 1 February, 2023).\",\n    \"4:06 pm on 23 January, 2023: Deborah and Jolene met and had a conversation on 23 January, 2023 (at 4:06 pm).\",\n    \"9:26 am on 1 August, 2023: Jolene had a huge setback with her project last week (time relative to a specific day: '1 August, 2023').\",\n    \"3:09 pm on 15 September, 2023: Jolene added that pets make life a lot brighter\",\n    \"10:17 am on 20 September, 2023: Jolene said she was planning to get out in nature again next month (time relative to a specific day: '20 September, 2023') and that it would be great to reconnect with it.\",\n    \"4:12 pm on 22 February, 2023: Jolene had a great night out on 2023-02-21 (originally stated as last night relative to 2023-02-22, i.e., 2023-02-21), which included dinner and drinks with her friends; image: https://i.redd.it/l2ug8nsuyt0b1.jpg; title: a photo of a plate of food and a glass of wine\",\n    \"9:49 am on 27 January, 2023: Deborah said, 'Cool, Jolene!

These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6.

{"data_source": "evaluation_metrics_20251221_122846_combined", "prompt": [{"content": "\n    You are an intelligent memory assistant tasked with retrieving accurate information from conversation memories.\n\n    # CONTEXT:\n    You have access to memories from two speakers in a conversation. These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references unless instructed to keep them.\n\n    Memories for user Deborah:\n\n    [\n    \"9:49 am on 27 January, 2023: Jolene bought something a year ago in Paris.\",\n    \"9:49 am on 27 January, 2023: Jolene bought Seraphim a year ago in Paris (originally stated as a year ago relative to 2023-01-27, i.e., 2022-01-27).\",\n    \"4:50 pm on 25 February, 2023: Jolene and her partner have been together for three years but are not yet married; they are taking it slow and enjoying the journey (originally stated as 'we've been together for three years').\",\n    \"9:11 am on 21 August, 2023: Jolene has been doing yoga for 3 years, as she stated in response to Deborah's question; she finds it a great way to escape studying and work stress\",\n    \"12:52 am on 19 August, 2023: Jolene once won three large pizzas from playing Overcooked 2.\",\n    \"11:46 am on 30 August, 2023: Jolene shared a photo of a group of people walking up a set of stairs from Rio de Janeiro, where they went on many excursions and visited an old temple.\",\n    \"4:12 pm on 22 February, 2023: Jolene asked Deborah where else she has traveled.\",\n    \"3:09 pm on 15 September, 2023: Jolene has a pet named Susie who has been with her for two years; image: https://i.redd.it/ckp5j9w7q7q41.jpg; title: a photo of a person holding a snake in a container\",\n    \"9:34 am on 24 August, 2023: Jolene has been studying, attending workshops, and networking to achieve her goal (stated by Jolene).\",\n    \"4:12 pm on 22 February, 2023: Jolene had a great night out on 2023-02-21 (originally stated as last night relative to 2023-02-22, i.e., 2023-02-21), which included dinner and drinks with her friends; image: https://i.redd.it/l2ug8nsuyt0b1.jpg; title: a photo of a plate of food and a glass of wine\",\n    \"2:18 pm on 12 September, 2023: Jolene and her partner traveled to a meditation retreat in Phuket for a few weeks last weekend (time relative to a specific day: 'last weekend' relative to 12 September, 2023, i.e., 8-10 September, 2023)\",\n    \"10:17 am on 20 September, 2023: Jolene said she and her partner had an awesome time at a music festival last year; it was her way of expressing herself and getting away from the stress of everyday life.\",\n    \"9:34 am on 24 August, 2023: Jolene is currently focusing on studying and gaining more experience (stated by Jolene).\",\n    \"3:56 pm on 6 June, 2023: Jolene has been testing her skills and gaining real-world experience during the internship.\",\n    \"2:14 pm on 3 September, 2023: Jolene mentioned that she is thinking about taking a trip somewhere to relax and recharge after her finals.\",\n    \"1:24 pm on 17 September, 2023: Jolene said that reading the book in the photo takes her to another world\",\n    \"9:03 pm on 9 February, 2023: Jolene has not yet reached out to any schools or centers.\",\n    \"5:33 pm on 26 August, 2023: Jolene is keen on coming up with new ideas and making things more efficient to make the world a better place.\",\n    \"3:09 pm on 15 September, 2023: Jolene confirmed that the pet in the image is Susie and stated that she has had her for two years\",\n    \"9:26 am on 1 August, 2023: Jolene had a huge setback with her project last week (time relative to a specific day: '1 August, 2023').\",\n    \"4:50 pm on 25 February, 2023: Deborah asked Jolene how long she has been married.\",\n    \"10:17 am on 20 September, 2023: Jolene said she was planning to get out in nature again next month (time relative to a specific day: '20 September, 2023') and that it would be great to reconnect with it.\",\n    \"9:03 pm on 9 February, 2023: Jolene did a mini retreat last Wednesday (originally stated as last Wednesday relative to 2023-02-09, i.e., 2023-02-08) to assess where she's at in life.\",\n    \"2:14 pm on 3 September, 2023: Jolene said that she has a lot of finals coming up this month, so she has been studying real hard.

These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references unless instructed to keep them.\n\n    Memories for user Deborah:\n\n    [\n    \"7:03 pm on 1 February, 2023: Deborah met Anna at yoga in the park (originally stated on 1 February, 2023).\",\n    \"9:48 am on 4 February, 2023: Deborah bonded with Anna during yesterday's yoga class (originally stated as yesterday relative to 2023-02-04, i.e., 2023-02-03); image: https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/64343f0505054d3701b51289/ead98f94-3604-496b-8a00-9f796aafb2d7/Reve_December22_CarleyRuddPhotography%2865of86%29.jpg; title: a photo of two women in a dance studio doing a dance pose\",\n    \"4:06 pm on 23 January, 2023: Deborah and Jolene met and had a conversation on 23 January, 2023 (at 4:06 pm).\",\n    \"5:35 pm on 22 March, 2023: Deborah mentioned that recently, she and Anna were sitting by the sea, watching the sunset and talking about each other, and realized they inspire each other.\",\n    \"12:52 am on 19 August, 2023: Deborah mentioned that she told Anna the story of her life last Friday and they were super kind about it.\",\n    \"12:52 am on 19 August, 2023: Deborah found it nice to have a meaningful connection with Anna.\",\n    \"4:30 pm on 9 April, 2023: Deborah attended an art show with a friend on 9 April, 2023 (originally stated as 'today').\",\n    \"7:37 pm on 9 July, 2023: Deborah started a running group with Anna and finds it awesome to connect with people who care about fitness; image: https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/grc-cim-1671133645.jpg; title: a photo of three men standing next to each other on a road\",\n    \"9:48 am on 4 February, 2023: Deborah mentioned that Anna also has a pendant she wears in memory of her mother, which brought them closer.\",\n    \"9:48 am on 4 February, 2023: Deborah said that the pose is difficult but it brought her closer to Anna and they supported each other\",\n    \"11:46 am on 30 August, 2023: Deborah mentioned she was in Rio de Janeiro three years ago (originally stated as three years ago relative to 2023-08-30, i.e., 2020-08-30) and took a beautiful photo on one of the excursions; image: https://i.redd.it/4dsrcyti38h31.jpg; title: a photo of a large stone structure with a mountain in the background\",\n    \"1:24 pm on 17 September, 2023: Deborah recently visited her mom's old house and sat on a bench on 2023-09-10 (originally stated as last Sunday relative to 2023-09-17).

{"data_source": "evaluation_metrics_20251221_122846_combined", "prompt": [{"content": "\n    You are an intelligent memory assistant tasked with retrieving accurate information from conversation memories.\n\n    # CONTEXT:\n    You have access to memories from two speakers in a conversation. These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references unless instructed to keep them.\n\n    Memories for user Deborah:\n\n    [\n    \"9:48 am on 4 February, 2023: Deborah complimented Jolene's book collection and asked if she had a favorite book lately.\",\n    \"2:14 pm on 3 September, 2023: Jolene's favorite game to play with her mom was 'Monster Hunter: World'\",\n    \"9:48 am on 4 February, 2023: Jolene mentioned she is currently into the book 'Sapiens,' which explores human history and the impact of technology; she finds it thought-provoking.\",\n    \"1:24 pm on 17 September, 2023: Jolene said she likes Deborah's bookshelf and mentioned that her bathroom has an aesthetic vibe, where she once read a self-discovery book that resonated with her; image: https://cdn.apartmenttherapy.info/image/upload/v1617640374/at/house%20tours/2021-04/Amara/21.jpg; title: a photo of a bathroom with a black and white wall and a wooden stool\",\n    \"1:24 pm on 17 September, 2023: Deborah responded positively to Jolene's comment about the bathroom and mentioned that a special book that helps with self-discovery is awesome, adding that a cozy nook is her best one; image: https://i.pinimg.com/originals/c8/d6/bc/c8d6bc6ad3b08172bdbc1665f3ed080b.jpg; title: a photo of a person walking on the beach with a surfboard\",\n    \"12:52 am on 19 August, 2023: Jolene finds it hard to choose a single favorite game.\",\n    \"1:24 pm on 17 September, 2023: Jolene's favorite cookie to make is a warm, gooey chocolate and soft, buttery cookie\",\n    \"7:18 pm on 2 March, 2023: Jolene said one of her favorite comfort dishes is lasagna.

{"data_source": "evaluation_metrics_20251221_122846_combined", "prompt": [{"content": "\n    You are an intelligent memory assistant tasked with retrieving accurate information from conversation memories.\n\n    # CONTEXT:\n    You have access to memories from two speakers in a conversation. These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references unless instructed to keep them.\n\n    Memories for user Deborah:\n\n    [\n    \"9:48 am on 4 February, 2023: Jolene shared a picture taken on vacation last summer in Bogota, describing it as beautiful and calming, with a sunset over the water.\",\n    \"4:06 pm on 23 January, 2023: Deborah and Jolene met and had a conversation on 23 January, 2023 (at 4:06 pm).\",\n    \"9:03 pm on 9 February, 2023: Jolene did a mini retreat last Wednesday (originally stated as last Wednesday relative to 2023-02-09, i.e., 2023-02-08) to assess where she's at in life.\",\n    \"7:03 pm on 1 February, 2023: Jolene is working on a robotics project given by her engineering professor (originally stated as 'a huge robotics project' on 1 February, 2023).\",\n    \"2:18 pm on 12 September, 2023: Jolene and her partner traveled to a meditation retreat in Phuket for a few weeks last weekend (time relative to a specific day: 'last weekend' relative to 12 September, 2023, i.e., 8-10 September, 2023)\",\n    \"9:03 pm on 9 February, 2023: Jolene designed and built a sustainable water purifier for a rural community in need.

{"data_source": "evaluation_metrics_20251221_122846_combined", "prompt": [{"content": "\n    You are an intelligent memory assistant tasked with retrieving accurate information from conversation memories.\n\n    # CONTEXT:\n    You have access to memories from two speakers in a conversation. These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references unless instructed to keep them.\n\n    Memories for user Deborah:\n\n    [\n    \"9:03 pm on 9 February, 2023: Jolene did a mini retreat last Wednesday (originally stated as last Wednesday relative to 2023-02-09, i.e., 2023-02-08) to assess where she's at in life.\",\n    \"9:03 pm on 9 February, 2023: Jolene designed and built a sustainable water purifier for a rural community in need.

These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references unless instructed to keep them.\n\n    Memories for user Deborah:\n\n    [\n    \"4:12 pm on 22 February, 2023: Deborah received a letter from group members thanking her for her positive influence on them; image: https://i.redd.it/lr823iakg38b1.jpg; title: a photo of a note written to someone on a piece of paper.

These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references unless instructed to keep them.\n\n    Memories for user Deborah:\n\n    [\n    \"7:18 pm on 2 March, 2023: Jolene took Seraphim to the park last Sunday (time relative to a specific day: 'last Sunday'), and Seraphim loved it.\",\n    \"9:49 am on 27 January, 2023: Jolene bought Seraphim a year ago in Paris (originally stated as a year ago relative to 2023-01-27, i.e., 2022-01-27).\",\n    \"2:18 pm on 12 September, 2023: Jolene and her partner traveled to a meditation retreat in Phuket for a few weeks last weekend (time relative to a specific day: 'last weekend' relative to 12 September, 2023, i.e., 8-10 September, 2023)\",\n    \"9:49 am on 27 January, 2023: Jolene shared a fun moment where Seraphim slinked out of her cage while she was playing video games and coiled up next to her.\",\n    \"9:49 am on 27 January, 2023: Jolene has another snake named Seraphim.\",\n    \"9:17 am on 26 June, 2023: An image was shared by Jolene showing a snake named Seraphim curled up in a plant filled area;

{"data_source": "evaluation_metrics_20251221_122846_combined", "prompt": [{"content": "\n    You are an intelligent memory assistant tasked with retrieving accurate information from conversation memories.\n\n    # CONTEXT:\n    You have access to memories from two speakers in a conversation. These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references unless instructed to keep them.\n\n    Memories for user Deborah:\n\n    [\n    \"7:03 pm on 1 February, 2023: Jolene is working on a robotics project given by her engineering professor (originally stated as 'a huge robotics project' on 1 February, 2023).\",\n    \"7:03 pm on 1 February, 2023: Jolene is currently enjoying working on the robotics project and finds it satisfying to see the robot come together (originally stated on 1 February, 2023).\",\n    \"9:48 am on 4 February, 2023: Jolene finds the robotics project challenging but fun and it is making her get creative and problem-solve (originally stated on 1 February, 2023).

These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references unless instructed to keep them.\n\n    Memories for user Deborah:\n\n    [\n    \"7:03 pm on 1 February, 2023: Jolene is working on a robotics project given by her engineering professor (originally stated as 'a huge robotics project' on 1 February, 2023).\",\n    \"5:35 pm on 22 March, 2023: Jolene is using the Pomodoro Technique (25 minutes work, 5-minute break) to avoid burnout but is still struggling with prioritization.\",\n    \"7:03 pm on 1 February, 2023: Jolene is currently enjoying working on the robotics project and finds it satisfying to see the robot come together (originally stated on 1 February, 2023).\",\n    \"7:03 pm on 1 February, 2023: Deborah said that Jolene is enjoying the process of working on the robotics project and that it must be satisfying to see it come together (originally stated on 1 February, 2023); image: https://i.redd.it/nx6fg5910bb61.jpg; title: a photo of a table with a robot on it and a laptop\",\n    \"9:26 am on 1 August, 2023: Jolene had a huge setback with her project last week (time relative to a specific day: '1 August, 2023').\",\n    \"9:48 am on 4 February, 2023: Jolene finds the robotics project challenging but fun and it is making her get creative and problem-solve (originally stated on 1 February, 2023).

{"data_source": "evaluation_metrics_20251221_122846_combined", "prompt": [{"content": "\n    You are an intelligent memory assistant tasked with retrieving accurate information from conversation memories.\n\n    # CONTEXT:\n    You have access to memories from two speakers in a conversation. These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references unless instructed to keep them.\n\n    Memories for user Deborah:\n\n    [\n    \"12:52 am on 19 August, 2023: Deborah recalled playing games with her husband, taking turns and bonding through the activity.\",\n    \"9:03 pm on 9 February, 2023: Deborah noted that it's good that Jolene and her partner have something to do together.

{"data_source": "evaluation_metrics_20251221_122846_combined", "prompt": [{"content": "\n    You are an intelligent memory assistant tasked with retrieving accurate information from conversation memories.\n\n    # CONTEXT:\n    You have access to memories from two speakers in a conversation. These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references unless instructed to keep them.\n\n    Memories for user Deborah:\n\n    [\n    \"2:18 pm on 12 September, 2023: Deborah mentions that she recently played a card game about cats, where players take cards one by one from a deck and can attack their opponent with them.

{"data_source": "evaluation_metrics_20251221_122846_combined", "prompt": [{"content": "\n    You are an intelligent memory assistant tasked with retrieving accurate information from conversation memories.\n\n    # CONTEXT:\n    You have access to memories from two speakers in a conversation. These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references unless instructed to keep them.\n\n    Memories for user Deborah:\n\n    [\n    \"9:34 am on 24 August, 2023: Deborah mentioned that she went to a yoga retreat near her mom's place last week (time relative to a specific day: 'last week').\",\n    \"1:24 pm on 17 September, 2023: Deborah recently visited her mom's old house and sat on a bench on 2023-09-10 (originally stated as last Sunday relative to 2023-09-17).

These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references unless instructed to keep them.\n\n    Memories for user Deborah:\n\n    [\n    \"5:33 pm on 26 August, 2023: Deborah has cats; image: https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49196167313_5eabd5ca56_b.jpg; title: a photography of two cats sitting on a couch with a blanket.

{"data_source": "evaluation_metrics_20251221_122846_combined", "prompt": [{"content": "\n    You are an intelligent memory assistant tasked with retrieving accurate information from conversation memories.\n\n    # CONTEXT:\n    You have access to memories from two speakers in a conversation. These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references unless instructed to keep them.\n\n    Memories for user Deborah:\n\n    [\n    \"10:17 am on 20 September, 2023: Jolene remembered taking a hike with her partner and coming across a waterfall oasis, which made her feel peaceful and refreshed.\",\n    \"11:46 am on 30 August, 2023: Jolene shared a photo of a group of people walking up a set of stairs from Rio de Janeiro, where they went on many excursions and visited an old temple.\",\n    \"4:30 pm on 9 April, 2023: Jolene plays video games with her partner after a long day as a way to relax.\",\n    \"10:17 am on 20 September, 2023: Jolene recently returned from a trip with her partner, which she described as 'so cool'; the trip was a yoga retreat in a peaceful location with an amazing view during yoga, specifically a sunrise that lit up the sky with bright colors.

These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references unless instructed to keep them.\n\n    Memories for user Deborah:\n\n    [\n    \"11:46 am on 30 August, 2023: Deborah mentioned she was in Rio de Janeiro three years ago (originally stated as three years ago relative to 2023-08-30, i.e., 2020-08-30) and took a beautiful photo on one of the excursions; image: https://i.redd.it/4dsrcyti38h31.jpg; title: a photo of a large stone structure with a mountain in the background\",\n    \"4:30 pm on 9 April, 2023: Deborah attended an art show with a friend on 9 April, 2023 (originally stated as 'today').\",\n    \"1:24 pm on 17 September, 2023: Deborah recently visited her mom's old house and sat on a bench on 2023-09-10 (originally stated as last Sunday relative to 2023-09-17).

{"data_source": "evaluation_metrics_20251221_122846_combined", "prompt": [{"content": "\n    You are an intelligent memory assistant tasked with retrieving accurate information from conversation memories.\n\n    # CONTEXT:\n    You have access to memories from two speakers in a conversation. These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references unless instructed to keep them.\n\n    Memories for user Deborah:\n\n    [\n    \"11:46 am on 30 August, 2023: Jolene said she is sorry for Deborah's friend not being able to support her and called the quote a good reminder to stay focused and let go of what no longer serves us.\",\n    \"11:46 am on 30 August, 2023: Deborah encouraged Jolene by saying that her efforts will bear fruit and not to give up.

{"data_source": "evaluation_metrics_20251221_122846_combined", "prompt": [{"content": "\n    You are an intelligent memory assistant tasked with retrieving accurate information from conversation memories.\n\n    # CONTEXT:\n    You have access to memories from two speakers in a conversation. These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4.

{"data_source": "evaluation_metrics_20251221_122846_combined", "prompt": [{"content": "\n    You are an intelligent memory assistant tasked with retrieving accurate information from conversation memories.\n\n    # CONTEXT:\n    You have access to memories from two speakers in a conversation. These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references unless instructed to keep them.\n\n    Memories for user Deborah:\n\n    [\n    \"1:24 pm on 17 September, 2023: Jolene tried a scuba diving lesson last Friday (time relative to a specific day: 'last Friday') and found a cool dive spot to explore together.

These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references unless instructed to keep them.\n\n    Memories for user Deborah:\n\n    [\n    \"2:18 pm on 12 September, 2023: Jolene and her partner traveled to a meditation retreat in Phuket for a few weeks last weekend (time relative to a specific day: 'last weekend' relative to 12 September, 2023, i.e., 8-10 September, 2023)\",\n    \"4:12 pm on 22 February, 2023: Jolene had a great night out on 2023-02-21 (originally stated as last night relative to 2023-02-22, i.e., 2023-02-21), which included dinner and drinks with her friends; image: https://i.redd.it/l2ug8nsuyt0b1.jpg; title: a photo of a plate of food and a glass of wine\",\n    \"10:17 am on 20 September, 2023: Jolene said she was planning to get out in nature again next month (time relative to a specific day: '20 September, 2023') and that it would be great to reconnect with it.\",\n    \"9:49 am on 27 January, 2023: Jolene bought Seraphim a year ago in Paris (originally stated as a year ago relative to 2023-01-27, i.e., 2022-01-27).\",\n    \"4:06 pm on 23 January, 2023: Deborah and Jolene met and had a conversation on 23 January, 2023 (at 4:06 pm).\",\n    \"9:03 pm on 9 February, 2023: Jolene did a mini retreat last Wednesday (originally stated as last Wednesday relative to 2023-02-09, i.e., 2023-02-08) to assess where she's at in life.\",\n    \"7:37 pm on 9 July, 2023: Jolene mentioned that gaming has been tough lately, but she is grateful to have someone who shares her interest in gaming; her partner helps her stay focused on their goals.

{"data_source": "evaluation_metrics_20251221_122846_combined", "prompt": [{"content": "\n    You are an intelligent memory assistant tasked with retrieving accurate information from conversation memories.\n\n    # CONTEXT:\n    You have access to memories from two speakers in a conversation. These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references unless instructed to keep them.\n\n    Memories for user Deborah:\n\n    [\n    \"7:39 pm on 8 September, 2023: Jolene includes self-care activities like yoga and meditation in her routine to stay balanced and relaxed.\",\n    \"9:34 am on 24 August, 2023: Jolene is currently focusing on studying and gaining more experience (stated by Jolene).\",\n    \"3:56 pm on 6 June, 2023: Jolene has been testing her skills and gaining real-world experience during the internship.\",\n    \"7:39 pm on 8 September, 2023: Jolene emphasized the importance of self-care activities like yoga and meditation in staying balanced and relaxed.\",\n    \"5:33 pm on 26 August, 2023: Jolene wants to get involved with organizations that focus on social causes using her engineering skills.\",\n    \"3:56 pm on 6 June, 2023: Deborah suggested that Jolene consider taking breaks and finding activities like yoga to help her relax and unwind.\",\n    \"9:34 am on 24 August, 2023: Jolene is considering more internships to enhance her skills (stated by Jolene).\",\n    \"4:50 pm on 25 February, 2023: Jolene claims that yoga has helped her chill out and gain perspective, making her more alert and motivated afterward.\",\n    \"4:30 pm on 9 April, 2023: Jolene says that these activities bring her and her partner closer together.\",\n    \"9:34 am on 24 August, 2023: Jolene has been studying, attending workshops, and networking to achieve her goal (stated by Jolene).\",\n    \"7:39 pm on 8 September, 2023: Jolene mentions having a routine that helps her stay on top of her tasks, including classes, studying, and personal time.\",\n    \"12:52 am on 19 August, 2023: Jolene is excited about making a plan to manage her studies and hobbies.\",\n    \"5:33 pm on 26 August, 2023: Jolene is an engineering student who wants to use her talents to do good and help solve important problems.\",\n    \"9:34 am on 24 August, 2023: Jolene's goal is to be successful in her field and make a positive impact (stated by Jolene).\",\n    \"2:58 pm on 16 August, 2023: Jolene is trying to prioritize self-care, such as yoga and meditation, to stay balanced and grounded.

{"data_source": "evaluation_metrics_20251221_122846_combined", "prompt": [{"content": "\n    You are an intelligent memory assistant tasked with retrieving accurate information from conversation memories.\n\n    # CONTEXT:\n    You have access to memories from two speakers in a conversation. These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references unless instructed to keep them.\n\n    Memories for user Deborah:\n\n    [\n    \"9:48 am on 4 February, 2023: Deborah complimented Jolene's book collection and asked if she had a favorite book lately.\",\n    \"2:14 pm on 3 September, 2023: Jolene's favorite game to play with her mom was 'Monster Hunter: World'\",\n    \"9:48 am on 4 February, 2023: Jolene mentioned she is currently into the book 'Sapiens,' which explores human history and the impact of technology; she finds it thought-provoking.\",\n    \"1:24 pm on 17 September, 2023: Jolene said she likes Deborah's bookshelf and mentioned that her bathroom has an aesthetic vibe, where she once read a self-discovery book that resonated with her; image: https://cdn.apartmenttherapy.info/image/upload/v1617640374/at/house%20tours/2021-04/Amara/21.jpg; title: a photo of a bathroom with a black and white wall and a wooden stool\",\n    \"1:24 pm on 17 September, 2023: Deborah responded positively to Jolene's comment about the bathroom and mentioned that a special book that helps with self-discovery is awesome, adding that a cozy nook is her best one; image: https://i.pinimg.com/originals/c8/d6/bc/c8d6bc6ad3b08172bdbc1665f3ed080b.jpg; title: a photo of a person walking on the beach with a surfboard\",\n    \"12:52 am on 19 August, 2023: Jolene finds it hard to choose a single favorite game.\",\n    \"1:24 pm on 17 September, 2023: Jolene's favorite cookie to make is a warm, gooey chocolate and soft, buttery cookie\",\n    \"7:18 pm on 2 March, 2023: Jolene said one of her favorite comfort dishes is lasagna.

These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references unless instructed to keep them.\n\n    Memories for user Deborah:\n\n    [\n    \"2:18 pm on 12 September, 2023: Deborah mentions that she recently played a card game about cats, where players take cards one by one from a deck and can attack their opponent with them.

These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references unless instructed to keep them.\n\n    Memories for user Deborah:\n\n    [\n    \"7:03 pm on 1 February, 2023: Jolene is working on a robotics project given by her engineering professor (originally stated as 'a huge robotics project' on 1 February, 2023).\",\n    \"7:03 pm on 1 February, 2023: Jolene is currently enjoying working on the robotics project and finds it satisfying to see the robot come together (originally stated on 1 February, 2023).\",\n    \"5:33 pm on 26 August, 2023: Jolene is particularly interested in two projects: one focused on developing renewable energy, like solar, to help communities and reduce dependence on non-renewables; the other focused on supplying clean water to those with limited access.\",\n    \"3:56 pm on 6 June, 2023: Jolene wrapped up a tough engineering project last month (originally stated as last month relative to 2023-06-06, i.e., May 2023).\",\n    \"1:24 pm on 17 September, 2023: Jolene suggests planning for next month and says she will check her schedule to let Deborah know.\",\n    \"4:06 pm on 23 January, 2023: Jolene mentioned that she finished an electrical engineering project last week (time relative to a specific day: '23 January, 2023').\",\n    \"9:49 am on 27 January, 2023: Jolene said, 'We are planning to play \\\"Walking Dead\\\" next Saturday.'

{"data_source": "evaluation_metrics_20251221_122846_combined", "prompt": [{"content": "\n    You are an intelligent memory assistant tasked with retrieving accurate information from conversation memories.\n\n    # CONTEXT:\n    You have access to memories from two speakers in a conversation. These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references unless instructed to keep them.\n\n    Memories for user Deborah:\n\n    [\n    \"7:03 pm on 1 February, 2023: Jolene is working on a robotics project given by her engineering professor (originally stated as 'a huge robotics project' on 1 February, 2023).\",\n    \"7:03 pm on 1 February, 2023: Jolene is currently enjoying working on the robotics project and finds it satisfying to see the robot come together (originally stated on 1 February, 2023).\",\n    \"7:03 pm on 1 February, 2023: Deborah said that Jolene is enjoying the process of working on the robotics project and that it must be satisfying to see it come together (originally stated on 1 February, 2023); image: https://i.redd.it/nx6fg5910bb61.jpg; title: a photo of a table with a robot on it and a laptop\",\n    \"9:48 am on 4 February, 2023: Jolene finds the robotics project challenging but fun and it is making her get creative and problem-solve (originally stated on 1 February, 2023).

These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references unless instructed to keep them.\n\n    Memories for user Deborah:\n\n    [\n    \"9:03 pm on 9 February, 2023: Deborah asked Jolene what cool stuff she accomplished at the retreat.\",\n    \"9:03 pm on 9 February, 2023: Jolene designed and built a sustainable water purifier for a rural community in need.

{"data_source": "evaluation_metrics_20251221_122846_combined", "prompt": [{"content": "\n    You are an intelligent memory assistant tasked with retrieving accurate information from conversation memories.\n\n    # CONTEXT:\n    You have access to memories from two speakers in a conversation. These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references unless instructed to keep them.\n\n    Memories for user Deborah:\n\n    [\n    \"9:03 pm on 9 February, 2023: Jolene mentioned an idea for a volunteer program where engineers teach STEM to underprivileged kids.\",\n    \"7:03 pm on 1 February, 2023: Jolene is working on a robotics project given by her engineering professor (originally stated as 'a huge robotics project' on 1 February, 2023).\",\n    \"9:48 am on 4 February, 2023: Jolene finds the robotics project challenging but fun and it is making her get creative and problem-solve (originally stated on 1 February, 2023).

These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4.

{"data_source": "evaluation_metrics_20251221_122846_combined", "prompt": [{"content": "\n    You are an intelligent memory assistant tasked with retrieving accurate information from conversation memories.\n\n    # CONTEXT:\n    You have access to memories from two speakers in a conversation. These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references unless instructed to keep them.\n\n    Memories for user Deborah:\n\n    [\n    \"2:58 pm on 16 August, 2023: Jolene mentioned she has been trying out some time management strategies and started using a bullet journal, which has been helpful for tracking tasks and staying organized.\",\n    \"7:18 pm on 2 March, 2023: Jolene thanked Deborah for the help with studying and time management.\",\n    \"7:18 pm on 2 March, 2023: Jolene asked Deborah for tips on studying or time management\",\n    \"7:39 pm on 8 September, 2023: Jolene mentioned that having a routine helps her manage her schedule, which includes classes, studying, and personal time.\",\n    \"7:39 pm on 8 September, 2023: Jolene mentions having a routine that helps her stay on top of her tasks, including classes, studying, and personal time.\",\n    \"11:22 am on 13 March, 2023: Jolene asked Deborah if they can still talk about time management.\",\n    \"7:18 pm on 2 March, 2023: Deborah provided Jolene with a tip on studying by suggesting to break it into smaller pieces and set goals for oneself.\",\n    \"12:52 am on 19 August, 2023: Jolene expressed admiration for Deborah's event and said she would make a plan to manage her studies and hobbies.\",\n    \"8:31 pm on 6 September, 2023: Jolene said, 'Bye, Deb!

These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references unless instructed to keep them.\n\n    Memories for user Deborah:\n\n    [\n    \"11:46 am on 30 August, 2023: Jolene responded, 'Thanks Deb!

These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references unless instructed to keep them.\n\n    Memories for user Deborah:\n\n    [\n    \"9:49 am on 27 January, 2023: Jolene's pet snake helps her feel calm and happy.\",\n    \"7:37 pm on 9 July, 2023: Jolene was fascinated by reptiles and found them to be the perfect pet for her.\",\n    \"7:37 pm on 9 July, 2023: During the 'snake adventure', Jolene's pet snake escaped and she spent hours searching for it.\",\n    \"9:26 am on 1 August, 2023: Jolene adopted her pet two years ago when she was feeling lonely and wanted some company.\",\n    \"7:37 pm on 9 July, 2023: Jolene shared a favorite memory involving her pet, which she referred to as a 'snake adventure'.\",\n    \"5:33 pm on 26 August, 2023: Jolene said her snakes just like watching her chill, and that she finds them to be great company that always brings a sense of calm.\",\n    \"7:37 pm on 9 July, 2023: Jolene would like to run more often and believes that snakes would motivate her and make it more fun.

These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4.

{"data_source": "evaluation_metrics_20251221_122846_combined", "prompt": [{"content": "\n    You are an intelligent memory assistant tasked with retrieving accurate information from conversation memories.\n\n    # CONTEXT:\n    You have access to memories from two speakers in a conversation. These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references unless instructed to keep them.\n\n    Memories for user Deborah:\n\n    [\n    \"7:37 pm on 9 July, 2023: Jolene felt love and gratitude upon finding her snake under the bed.\",\n    \"7:37 pm on 9 July, 2023: Jolene felt relieved when she found her snake snuggling under the bed.\",\n    \"9:49 am on 27 January, 2023: Jolene shared an image of Susie with a caption describing a bed with a snake head sticking out of it; image: https://i.redd.it/gvb5983gs2z71.jpg; title: a photo of a bed with a snake head sticking out of it\",\n    \"5:33 pm on 26 August, 2023: Jolene said her snakes just like watching her chill, and that she finds them to be great company that always brings a sense of calm.\",\n    \"9:49 am on 27 January, 2023: Jolene's pet snake helps her feel calm and happy.\",\n    \"4:30 pm on 9 April, 2023: Jolene mentioned that her snakes can't chat or understand her emotions but that time spent with them is valuable and teaches her to be in tune with herself.\",\n    \"4:30 pm on 9 April, 2023: Jolene finds value in spending time with her snakes, as it teaches her to take time and be in tune with herself.\",\n    \"9:49 am on 27 January, 2023: Jolene shared an image of Seraphim with a caption describing a snake sticking its head out of a blanket; image: https://i.redd.it/8aunav15kyq01.jpg; title: a photo of a snake sticking its head out of a blanket\",\n    \"7:37 pm on 9 July, 2023: The memory made Jolene realize how much she loves her snake.\",\n    \"7:37 pm on 9 July, 2023: During the 'snake adventure', Jolene's pet snake escaped and she spent hours searching for it.\",\n    \"7:18 pm on 2 March, 2023: Jolene said they explored new places and that people are surprised when they see a tamed snake.\",\n    \"7:37 pm on 9 July, 2023: Jolene shared a favorite memory involving her pet, which she referred to as a 'snake adventure'.\",\n    \"9:17 am on 26 June, 2023: An image was shared by Jolene showing a snake named Seraphim curled up in a plant filled area; image: https://i.redd.it/6moonjm3bypa1.jpg; title: a photo of a snake curled up in a plant filled area.\",\n    \"9:49 am on 27 January, 2023: Jolene has another snake named Seraphim.\",\n    \"9:49 am on 27 January, 2023: Jolene shared a fun moment where Seraphim slinked out of her cage while she was playing video games and coiled up next to her.\",\n    \"5:35 pm on 22 March, 2023: Jolene said it can often feel overwhelming and difficult to figure out where to start.\",\n    \"7:37 pm on 9 July, 2023: Jolene would like to run more often and believes that snakes would motivate her and make it more fun.

These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6.

{"data_source": "evaluation_metrics_20251221_122846_combined", "prompt": [{"content": "\n    You are an intelligent memory assistant tasked with retrieving accurate information from conversation memories.\n\n    # CONTEXT:\n    You have access to memories from two speakers in a conversation. These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references unless instructed to keep them.\n\n    Memories for user Deborah:\n\n    [\n    \"9:26 am on 1 August, 2023: Jolene mentioned that Susie helps her when times get tough, and that pets and video games have been a distraction (on 1 August, 2023); image: https://i.redd.it/0uzy21np69b51.jpg; title: a photo of a man holding a snake on his arm\",\n    \"4:30 pm on 9 April, 2023: Deborah agrees that simple things can bring the most happiness and asks how these activities have helped Jolene during tough times.\",\n    \"3:56 pm on 6 June, 2023: Deborah suggested that Jolene consider taking breaks and finding activities like yoga to help her relax and unwind.\",\n    \"7:39 pm on 8 September, 2023: Jolene emphasized the importance of self-care activities like yoga and meditation in staying balanced and relaxed.\",\n    \"7:39 pm on 8 September, 2023: Jolene includes self-care activities like yoga and meditation in her routine to stay balanced and relaxed.\",\n    \"7:37 pm on 9 July, 2023: Jolene mentioned that gaming has been tough lately, but she is grateful to have someone who shares her interest in gaming; her partner helps her stay focused on their goals.

These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references unless instructed to keep them.\n\n    Memories for user Deborah:\n\n    [\n    \"12:52 am on 19 August, 2023: Deborah recalled playing games with her husband, taking turns and bonding through the activity.\",\n    \"12:52 am on 19 August, 2023: Deborah used to play video games but hasn't done so in a while.\",\n    \"9:49 am on 27 January, 2023: Deborah is trying to channel her grief by spending more time with family and cherishing memories.\",\n    \"11:46 am on 30 August, 2023: Deborah mentioned that a place brought back fond memories as she relaxed outside.\",\n    \"11:46 am on 30 August, 2023: Deborah thanked Jolene for her kind words and mentioned that she is comforted by remembering her time with her friend, which reminds her of how special life is.

{"data_source": "evaluation_metrics_20251221_122846_combined", "prompt": [{"content": "\n    You are an intelligent memory assistant tasked with retrieving accurate information from conversation memories.\n\n    # CONTEXT:\n    You have access to memories from two speakers in a conversation. These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references unless instructed to keep them.\n\n    Memories for user Deborah:\n\n    [\n    \"12:52 am on 19 August, 2023: Deborah feels peace and gratitude every time she returns to the bench, reflecting on the time she spent with her mom.\",\n    \"3:09 pm on 15 September, 2023: Deborah felt that the time spent with her mom's friends was meaningful and helped her appreciate her mom more.\",\n    \"9:49 am on 27 January, 2023: Deborah feels connected to her mother when she sits in that spot.

These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references unless instructed to keep them.\n\n    Memories for user Deborah:\n\n    [\n    \"10:17 am on 20 September, 2023: Jolene recently returned from a trip with her partner, which she described as 'so cool'; the trip was a yoga retreat in a peaceful location with an amazing view during yoga, specifically a sunrise that lit up the sky with bright colors.

These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references unless instructed to keep them.\n\n    Memories for user Deborah:\n\n    [\n    \"9:34 am on 24 August, 2023: Jolene presented at a virtual conference and received positive feedback (stated by Jolene; vague time expression: 'recently').\",\n    \"9:34 am on 24 August, 2023: Jolene felt thrilled to receive positive feedback and found it rewarding to know her efforts were appreciated (stated by Jolene).\",\n    \"9:34 am on 24 August, 2023: Deborah praised Jolene for putting her heart and soul into her work and asked how it felt to receive positive feedback and what comes next (stated by Deborah).\",\n    \"7:03 pm on 1 February, 2023: Jolene felt a mix of emotions - excited and nervous - when she first received the project (originally stated on 1 February, 2023).\",\n    \"2:18 pm on 12 September, 2023: Jolene felt that the session was a strong reminder to appreciate the journey rather than just focusing on the finish line\",\n    \"5:35 pm on 22 March, 2023: Jolene felt motivated to try surfing after Deborah's encouragement.\",\n    \"11:22 am on 13 March, 2023: Jolene responded positively to Deborah's motivation, calling it cool.\",\n    \"4:03 pm on 28 March, 2023: Jolene feels great about her hard work paying off.\",\n    \"7:39 pm on 8 September, 2023: Jolene responded positively to Deborah's agreement and expressed excitement for their coffee date.\",\n    \"9:03 pm on 9 February, 2023: Jolene designed and built a sustainable water purifier for a rural community in need.

These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references unless instructed to keep them.\n\n    Memories for user Deborah:\n\n    [\n    \"5:33 pm on 26 August, 2023: Jolene's mom emphasized the value of helping others, which influences Jolene's approach to engineering projects.\",\n    \"3:56 pm on 6 June, 2023: Jolene said the internship has had a positive impact on her life, stoking her love of engineering and encouraging her to keep striving for her dreams.\",\n    \"9:03 pm on 9 February, 2023: Jolene designed and built a sustainable water purifier for a rural community in need.

{"data_source": "evaluation_metrics_20251221_122846_combined", "prompt": [{"content": "\n    You are an intelligent memory assistant tasked with retrieving accurate information from conversation memories.\n\n    # CONTEXT:\n    You have access to memories from two speakers in a conversation. These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references unless instructed to keep them.\n\n    Memories for user Deborah:\n\n    [\n    \"11:46 am on 30 August, 2023: Jolene said she goes to a nearby place to meditate by a tranquil spot; image: https://pandolinadventures.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/img_3720.jpg; title: a photo of a pond with lily pads and a tree in the background.\",\n    \"2:18 pm on 12 September, 2023: Jolene and her partner traveled to a meditation retreat in Phuket for a few weeks last weekend (time relative to a specific day: 'last weekend' relative to 12 September, 2023, i.e., 8-10 September, 2023)\",\n    \"8:31 pm on 6 September, 2023: Jolene signed up for a meditation course at a retreat near a lake; image: https://www.ic.org/wp-content/uploads/formidable/2/temple_may2021.jpg; title: a photo of a building with a curved roof on a hill\",\n    \"4:03 pm on 28 March, 2023: Jolene is practicing yoga and meditation to find calm amidst her busy schedule.

These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4.

{"data_source": "evaluation_metrics_20251221_122846_combined", "prompt": [{"content": "\n    You are an intelligent memory assistant tasked with retrieving accurate information from conversation memories.\n\n    # CONTEXT:\n    You have access to memories from two speakers in a conversation. These memories contain \n    timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.\n\n    # INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. Carefully analyze all provided memories.\n    2. Pay special attention to the timestamps (the timestamp is when the memory was recorded; relative phrases like \"this month\" refer to that timestamp’s month).\n    3. Time handling:\n       - If a relative time can be calculated to a specific day/month/year, compute it and also keep the original phrasing. Example: “July (originally referring to one month before August)”.\n       - If the relative time cannot be precisely calculated (e.g., weeks, “recently”, “early June”, “the first weekend”), do NOT convert; keep the original expression.\n       - Do not enforce ISO formatting; natural date/month wording is fine.\n    4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory.\n    5. For list or count questions, gather ALL required items and ensure counts are exact—no missing or extra items (e.g., list of deceased, list of cars, commonalities, etc.).\n    6. Focus only on the content of the memories. Do not confuse character names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.\n\n    # APPROACH (Think step by step):\n    1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question.\n    2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully.\n    3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question.\n    4. If time conversion is possible, perform it while keeping the original wording as noted above.\n    5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories.\n    6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked and that any counts/lists are complete and accurate.\n    7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references unless instructed to keep them.\n\n    Memories for user Deborah:\n\n    [\n    \"10:17 am on 20 September, 2023: Deborah had a great time at a music festival with her pals, describing the vibes as 'unreal' and the music as 'magical'; she felt freeing while dancing and bop around, and music reminded her of her mom's soothing voice when she'd sing lullabies to her.\",\n    \"4:30 pm on 9 April, 2023: Deborah attended an art show with a friend on 9 April, 2023 (originally stated as 'today').\",\n    \"4:50 pm on 25 February, 2023: Deborah went for a morning jog for the first time in a nearby park on 2023-02-24 (yesterday relative to 2023-02-25).\",\n    \"2:58 pm on 16 August, 2023: Deborah's workshops and events involve activities such as yoga, meditation, and self-reflection.
